2025-10-28 16:02:26,107 - INFO - Using prompt: Extract all genotype and NCBI accession information from the scientific article below. You MUST follow these steps:

        STEP 1 - SYSTEMATIC READING:
        Read the ENTIRE article text carefully, section by section:
        - Abstract: Check for study overview and organism mentions
        - Introduction: Look for study context and varieties being investigated
        - Materials and Methods: PRIMARY source for genotypes and sample descriptions
        - Results: Check for any additional genotype details or data references
        - Discussion: May contain references to data deposition
        - Data Availability Statement: CRITICAL section for NCBI accessions
        - Supplementary Information references: Note what information is external
        - Acknowledgments: Sometimes contains data repository information
        - TABLES: Pay special attention to tables (often formatted with pipes |, dashes -, or aligned columns). Tables frequently contain:
            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context
        - LOW: Ambiguous mentions, incomplete information, or indirect references

        STEP 5 - SOURCE TRACKING:
        - "main text": Information in the primary article body
        - "supplementary file": Referenced in supplementary materials (but actual content not in provided text)
        - "data availability statement": In data/code availability sections
        - "methods appendix": In detailed methods/materials sections
        - "not found": Information explicitly missing from the document

        STEP 6 - REASONING OUTPUT (MANDATORY):
        Before generating the final JSON, you MUST output your reasoning process in plain text using this format:
        
        === REASONING PROCESS ===
        1. Article Scan Summary: [Brief overview of what sections contain relevant information]
        2. Genotypes Found: [List all genotypes identified with their locations]
        3. Accessions Found: [List all NCBI accessions identified with their locations]
        4. Association Logic: [Explain how you linked genotypes to accessions]
        5. Ambiguities/Challenges: [Note any unclear cases or missing information]
        6. Confidence Rationale: [Explain confidence levels assigned]
        === END REASONING ===

        STEP 7 - GENERATE JSON OUTPUT:
        After your reasoning, create JSON following the exact format shown in the examples above.

        
        Example 1 - Complete Information:

        Article excerpt: "RNA was extracted from leaf samples of sugarcane cultivar 'SP80-3280' and 'RB867515'. Libraries were sequenced and deposited in NCBI under BioProject PRJNA123456 with individual SRA accessions SRR9876543 and SRR9876544 for SP80-3280 and RB867515, respectively."

        Reasoning Steps:
        1. Identify genotypes: Two cultivars mentioned - 'SP80-3280' and 'RB867515'
        2. Identify accessions: BioProject PRJNA123456, SRA accessions SRR9876543 and SRR9876544
        3. Link genotypes to accessions: Text explicitly links SP80-3280 to SRR9876543 and RB867515 to SRR9876544
        4. Assess confidence: HIGH - explicit mentions with clear associations
        5. Determine source location: This is in main text (methods section)

        Output:
        {
            "entries": [
                {
                    "accession": "SRR9876543",
                    "accession_type": "SRA",
                    "organism": "Saccharum spp.",
                    "genotype": "SP80-3280",
                    "confidence": "high",
                    "source_location": "main text",
                    "evidence_text": "SRA accessions SRR9876543 for SP80-3280"
                },
                {
                    "accession": "SRR9876544",
                    "accession_type": "SRA",
                    "organism": "Saccharum spp.",
                    "genotype": "RB867515",
                    "confidence": "high",
                    "source_location": "main text",
                    "evidence_text": "SRR9876544 for RB867515"
                }
            ],
            "notes": "Both cultivars clearly identified with direct SRA accession links under BioProject PRJNA123456"
        }

        Example 2 - Missing Accession:

        Article excerpt: "We analyzed drought stress responses in citrus variety 'Pera' grown under field conditions. Detailed sequencing information is provided in Supplementary Table S3."

        Reasoning Steps:
        1. Identify genotypes: One variety mentioned - 'Pera'
        2. Identify accessions: No accessions in this excerpt
        3. Check supplementary reference: Article mentions Supplementary Table S3 contains sequencing info
        4. Assess confidence: MEDIUM - genotype is clear, but accession location is referenced
        5. Determine source location: Genotype in main text, accession in supplementary file

        Output:
        {
            "entries": [
                {
                    "accession": null,
                    "accession_type": null,
                    "organism": "Citrus spp.",
                    "genotype": "Pera",
                    "confidence": "medium",
                    "source_location": "main text",
                    "evidence_text": "citrus variety 'Pera' grown under field conditions"
                }
            ],
            "notes": "Accession information referenced in Supplementary Table S3 but not provided in main text"
        }

        Example 3 - Table Format:

        Article excerpt: "Sequencing data for all samples are summarized in Table 2:

        Table 2. Sample information and sequencing accessions
        | Sample ID | Cultivar    | Tissue | SRA Accession | BioSample    |
        |-----------|-------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
        | S1        | Valencia    | Leaf   | SRR12345678   | SAMN10001234 |
        | S2        | Valencia    | Root   | SRR12345679   | SAMN10001235 |
        | S3        | Hamlin      | Leaf   | SRR12345680   | SAMN10001236 |

        All samples are deposited under BioProject PRJNA555555."

        Reasoning Steps:
        1. Identify table structure: This is clearly a table with pipe-delimited columns
        2. Parse table headers: Sample ID, Cultivar, Tissue, SRA Accession, BioSample
        3. Extract row data: Three samples with cultivars Valencia (2x) and Hamlin (1x)
        4. Link genotypes to accessions: Each row links cultivar to specific SRA and BioSample IDs
        5. Assess confidence: HIGH - explicit tabular mapping with clear associations
        6. Note BioProject: PRJNA555555 applies to all samples

        Output:
        {
            "entries": [
                {
                    "accession": "SRR12345678",

                }
            ],
            "notes": "All samples under BioProject PRJNA555555. Information extracted from Table 2 with clear cultivar-to-accession mappings."
        }

        Example 4 - No Information Found:

        Article excerpt: "Our review summarizes recent advances in plant genomics and their applications in breeding programs."

        Reasoning Steps:
        1. Search for genotypes: No specific cultivars, varieties, or strains mentioned
        2. Search for accessions: No NCBI identifiers present
        3. Check context: This is a review article without experimental data
        4. Assess completeness: No extractable information

        Output:
        {
            "entries": [],
            "notes": "This appears to be a review article with no specific genotype information or NCBI accessions mentioned in the provided text"

## 1 Supporting Video legends

1. SI Movie 1 Dynamical trajectories that emerge spontaneously for agents moving according to FSM, i.e. maximising their future accessible states. Here we use a standard set of parameters N = 50 ↪ τ = 4 ↪ n s = 40 ↪ ∆ θ = 15 ◦ ↪ v 0 = 10 ↪ ∆ v = 2. The agents are initially placed at random in a 100 × 100 box (all lengths in units of the particle size) and aligned with the x-axis up to a Gaussian-distributed noise on each agents orientation, with standard deviation σ = ∆ θ . When modelling future trajectories each agent here assumes that all other agents will continue to move ballistically, i.e. at the same orientation at nominal speed v 0 .
2. SI Movie 2 Dynamical trajectories under FSM as described in caption to Movie S1 but with N = 500 ↪ τ = 6.
3. SI Movie 3 Dynamical trajectories obtained under FSM with standard parameter values but where the visual di ff erence between states is computed using a continuous sensor model, as described in the next section below. The trajectories are qualitatively similar to those shown in Movie S1, with a slightly higher density.

A comparison of the trained neural network (left) mimicking the full FSM algorithm (right). The neural network is trained on 10 million training examples from the FSM algorithm over a variety of initial conditions with standard parameter values as given above and under the ballistic assumption for the future trajectories of other agents.

## 2 A continuous measure of visual degeneracy

Variations of our model are able to treat the overlap between visual states in a more continuous manner. In the main text we adopt a model that has the benefit of extreme simplicity - states are included simply according to whether they are distinct from all other states accessible on the decision tree and discarded if they are identical to any one of them. As before we define the visual state in terms of the geometric projection of the other agents but now assume a continuous sensor (infinite n s ). We then define a real-valued di ff erence between any two visual states f i ( θ ) and f j ( θ ), each a function on [0 ↪ 2 π ) that takes value 0 or 1, depending on whether the projection of (any) other agent occupies the sensor angle θ or not. The di ff erence d ij between these two states is defined as the fraction of the angular view over which they have di ff erent values, as shown in figure 1.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

We then generalize the FSM dynamics by using exactly the same algorithm outlined in the main text but rather than counting the number of distinct visual states accessible on each branch of the decision tree (with each realized state therefore counted as 1, if distinct, or 0, if degenerate) we instead assign a weight to each node that is the average di ff erence between this and every

Figure 1: (SI) The di ff erence between two continuous visual states. The continuous visual field of an agent can be constructed by taking a continuous projection of the other agents. This is similar to that shown in Fig 1(b) in the main text but without the discretisation that divides the angular field of view into a fixed number of sensors, i.e. the sensor is continuous. We then define a measure of the di ff erence d ij between any two visual states (such as states 1 and 2 shown) as the fraction of the angular field [0 ↪ 2 π ) where they have di ff erent values (1/0 or 0/1 respectively), as shown (red).

other state accessible on branch α . When summed over all nodes on that branch this gives the weight of that branch, W α . With n α the number of nodes on the α branch of the decision tree (after truncation on/after collisions, as before) this is therefore defined as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

FSM dynamics then involves the agents choosing whichever move in the present time t corresponds to the branch of the decision tree with the highest score W α . Movies showing the trajectories that emerge under this modification to our algorithm are shown in SI Movies 3 and 4. For smaller swarms the dynamics can be seen to be qualitatively extremely similar to those realized under the discrete version of FSM analysed in the main text. However, for larger swarms this continuous measure gives rise to much richer dynamics and is more robust to fragmentation.

## 3 Calculation of the correlation length

A correlation length is reported in Fig 2(b) in the main text. As in [7] we calculate the correlation function of the velocity in the centre of mass frame as a function of the distance between agents. That is, for each agent we define its velocity di ff erence u i = v i - 〈 v 〉 where v i is the agent's instantaneous velocity and 〈 v 〉 is the instantaneous average velocity of the centre of mass of all agents. We then compute the pairwise average of u i glyph[triangleright] u j and record this as a function of the distance between all pairs of agents. This is negative at large distances, becoming positive with decreasing separation. The correlation length is then defined as the point that this correlation function changes sign. It is this value that is reported in Fig 2(b) in the main text.

## 4 Robustness and collisions

In figure 2 we report the swarm's average order, opacity, density, and collision rates for a variety of parameter variations of the base model, as described in the main text.

Figure 2: (a) Robustness to variation of simulation parameter values. The visual opacity is the average fraction of sensors reading 1 and remains near 0.5; the density is N divided by the area within a convex hull containing the agents and remains a few %; the order is the average alignment and remains within a few % of perfect alignment. The 'standard' set of parameters are N = 50, τ = 4, n s = 40, ∆ θ = 15 ◦ , v 0 = 10, ∆ v = 2, s tol = 0 glyph[triangleright] 5 and noise = 0. The entries are labelled (bottom) with any parameters that di ff er from these values. Here s tol refers to the fraction of a sensor which needs to be filled for it to read 1 instead of 0. The noise value is the standard deviation of a Normal random variable with mean zero, which is added to both the angular orientation and the speed of each agent at each time step after it has selected a preferred move under FSM. This represents the only occasion that any extrinsic noise is introduced anywhere in this work. (b) Table showing average measures of collective FSM dynamics under various parameter values. The average order, density and opacity values correspond to the values shown in (a). We estimated the average di ff usion constant of the agents relative to the centre of mass D e ff by fitting the average mean-squared centre of mass frame displacement after time t to 4 D e ff t (in the linear regime). We then report a mean field estimate for the rate of collisions that we would expect for agents moving randomly with this di ff usion constant at the average density realised under these conditions. This represents a control value for the collision rate under such a Mean Field Theory (MFT) and is shown in the last column. Also reported is the actual rate of collisions realized in the FSM algorithm, shown in the penultimate column. Here collisions are assumed to occur in continuous time. Trajectories of each particles are interpolated between discrete time points and solid body overlap between any pair of agents (unit radius disks) at any moment in time is deemed to constitute a collision. In both columns the collision rate is the total number of collisions divided by the number of agents N , i.e. the collision rate per agent per time step. Note the substantial reduction in actual collisions from the MFT estimate, indicating natural collision avoidance under FSM.

2025-10-28 16:03:43,743 - INFO - Using prompt: Extract all genotype and NCBI accession information from the scientific article below. You MUST follow these steps:

        STEP 1 - SYSTEMATIC READING:
        Read the ENTIRE article text carefully, section by section:
        - Abstract: Check for study overview and organism mentions
        - Introduction: Look for study context and varieties being investigated
        - Materials and Methods: PRIMARY source for genotypes and sample descriptions
        - Results: Check for any additional genotype details or data references
        - Discussion: May contain references to data deposition
        - Data Availability Statement: CRITICAL section for NCBI accessions
        - Supplementary Information references: Note what information is external
        - Acknowledgments: Sometimes contains data repository information
        - TABLES: Pay special attention to tables (often formatted with pipes |, dashes -, or aligned columns). Tables frequently contain:
            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context
        - LOW: Ambiguous mentions, incomplete information, or indirect references

        STEP 5 - SOURCE TRACKING:
        - "main text": Information in the primary article body
        - "supplementary file": Referenced in supplementary materials (but actual content not in provided text)
        - "data availability statement": In data/code availability sections
        - "methods appendix": In detailed methods/materials sections
        - "not found": Information explicitly missing from the document

        STEP 6 - REASONING OUTPUT (MANDATORY):
        Before generating the final JSON, you MUST output your reasoning process in plain text using this format:
        
        === REASONING PROCESS ===
        1. Article Scan Summary: [Brief overview of what sections contain relevant information]
        2. Genotypes Found: [List all genotypes identified with their locations]
        3. Accessions Found: [List all NCBI accessions identified with their locations]
        4. Association Logic: [Explain how you linked genotypes to accessions]
        5. Ambiguities/Challenges: [Note any unclear cases or missing information]
        6. Confidence Rationale: [Explain confidence levels assigned]
        === END REASONING ===

        STEP 7 - GENERATE JSON OUTPUT:
        After your reasoning, create JSON following the exact format shown in the examples above.

        
        Example 1 - Complete Information:

        Article excerpt: "RNA was extracted from leaf samples of sugarcane cultivar 'SP80-3280' and 'RB867515'. Libraries were sequenced and deposited in NCBI under BioProject PRJNA123456 with individual SRA accessions SRR9876543 and SRR9876544 for SP80-3280 and RB867515, respectively."

        Reasoning Steps:
        1. Identify genotypes: Two cultivars mentioned - 'SP80-3280' and 'RB867515'
        2. Identify accessions: BioProject PRJNA123456, SRA accessions SRR9876543 and SRR9876544
        3. Link genotypes to accessions: Text explicitly links SP80-3280 to SRR9876543 and RB867515 to SRR9876544
        4. Assess confidence: HIGH - explicit mentions with clear associations
        5. Determine source location: This is in main text (methods section)

        Output:
        {
            "entries": [
                {
                    "accession": "SRR9876543",
                    "accession_type": "SRA",
                    "organism": "Saccharum spp.",
                    "genotype": "SP80-3280",
                    "confidence": "high",
                    "source_location": "main text",
                    "evidence_text": "SRA accessions SRR9876543 for SP80-3280"
                },
                {
                    "accession": "SRR9876544",
                    "accession_type": "SRA",
                    "organism": "Saccharum spp.",
                    "genotype": "RB867515",
                    "confidence": "high",
                    "source_location": "main text",
                    "evidence_text": "SRR9876544 for RB867515"
                }
            ],
            "notes": "Both cultivars clearly identified with direct SRA accession links under BioProject PRJNA123456"
        }

        Example 2 - Missing Accession:

        Article excerpt: "We analyzed drought stress responses in citrus variety 'Pera' grown under field conditions. Detailed sequencing information is provided in Supplementary Table S3."

        Reasoning Steps:
        1. Identify genotypes: One variety mentioned - 'Pera'
        2. Identify accessions: No accessions in this excerpt
        3. Check supplementary reference: Article mentions Supplementary Table S3 contains sequencing info
        4. Assess confidence: MEDIUM - genotype is clear, but accession location is referenced
        5. Determine source location: Genotype in main text, accession in supplementary file

        Output:
        {
            "entries": [
                {
                    "accession": null,
                    "accession_type": null,
                    "organism": "Citrus spp.",
                    "genotype": "Pera",
                    "confidence": "medium",
                    "source_location": "main text",
                    "evidence_text": "citrus variety 'Pera' grown under field conditions"
                }
            ],
            "notes": "Accession information referenced in Supplementary Table S3 but not provided in main text"
        }

        Example 3 - Table Format:

        FULL TEXT
Main Asexual reproduction is a remarkable feature of perennial fruit crops that facilitates the faithful propagation of commercially valuable individuals by avoiding the uncertainty associated with the sexual reproduction of hybrid plants. Many fruit crops reproduce or are propagated by asexual mechanisms. These mechanisms include natural means of propagation, such as layering, cutting and grafting 1 , and modern technologies, such as tissue culture. Apomixis is a naturally occurring mode of asexual reproduction that yields offspring that are genetically identical to the mother plant 2 . It is uncommon in agriculturally important crops apart from citrus and apple 3 . The first example of apomixis in citrus was reported in 1719, when Leeuwenhoek observed the development of two plantlets from the same seed 4 . A better understanding of apomixis and its introgression into agronomically important crops could potentially help revolutionize modern agriculture 5 . As demonstrated by fruit crops, apomixis enables breeders to fix valuable traits and heterozygosity. Most previous studies have focused on gametophytic apomixis 2 , 6 . Sporophytic apomixis, including nucellar embryony, is not as well studied. Apomixis in citrus is sporophytic—the embryos develop from somatic nucellar cells—and very stable among commercial varieties, including sweet oranges, mandarins, grapefruits and lemons 7 . In general, 2–10 embryos develop within a seed. However, in particular genotypes, 30 or more embryos can develop in one seed 3 , 8 . This phenomenon is typically called 'polyembryony' and is considered an important trait for breeding purposes. On the one hand, polyembryony is widely employed in citrus nurseries and propagation programs to generate large numbers of uniform rootstocks from seeds. On the other hand, polyembryony has sometimes caused problems for breeding that required sexual crosses. Data from crosses between monoembryonic and polyembryonic cultivars indicate that one or two dominant loci control polyembryony 9 , 10 . Molecular markers linked to a polyembryony locus have been reported 7 , 11 . This locus was later mapped to a genomic region that spans approximately 380 kb 12 . Genes differentially expressed during polyembryogenesis have also been identified 13 , 14 , 15 . Citrus fruit trees, designated as Citrinae, are a large group belonging to the subfamily Aurantioideae and the family Rutaceae 16 . Citrinae are classified into primitive citrus, near citrus and true citrus on the basis of botanical characteristics 16 . Atalantia buxifolia , also known as Chinese box orange and formerly named Severinia buxifolia , is an example of a primitive citrus species. The true citrus group comprises almost all of the commercially cultivated citrus, with major varieties belonging to the Citrus genus ( Supplementary Note 1 ). The best known citrus varieties are the sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ), mandarin ( Citrus reticulata ), lemon ( Citrus limon ), grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi ) and pummelo ( Citrus grandis or Citrus maxima ). There are a range of reproductive systems among the different varieties of primitive and modern citrus species that include sexual reproduction, clonal propagation and mixtures of these systems. We aimed to understand the genomic characteristics of primitive and cultivated citrus and the genetic basis of asexual reproduction in citrus. We de novo sequenced pummelo and three representative species of Citrinae. We also sequenced a population of 100 citrus accessions that ranged from primitive to cultivated citrus. Our genetic analyses of segregating and natural populations, and our transcriptome profiling, provide new insights into the genetic basis of apomixis in citrus. Results Citrinae phylogeny and reproductive systems Conserved single-copy genes from eight species of Citrinae were used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1a ). As expected, the primitive citrus Atalantia was located at a basal position in the tree. The spiny and wild species Citrus ichangensis (Ichang papeda, hereafter referred to as papeda) is phylogenetically located between primitive and cultivated citrus. The three basic species, C. reticulata (mandarin), C. grandis (pummelo) and C. medica (citron) showed close relationships to each other. Primitive, wild and cultivated citrus each have nine haploid chromosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Citrus species exhibit broad sexual compatibility. Interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations are feasible even between primitive and cultivated citrus 17 . Our experiments also support the grafting compatibility and partial sexual compatibility of Atalantia and Citrus ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Atalantia and papeda are mainly seed propagated, with large or many seeds that mostly fill the locules of the fruit ( Fig. 1b ), and are not suitable for propagation by grafting owing to strong and numerous prickles and stiff twigs ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). In contrast, the vegetative propagule that facilitates propagation by grafting has an ideal morphology in mandarin, pummelo, sweet orange and other cultivated citrus ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Figure 1 Phylogeny, genomes, fruits and seeds of primitive, wild and cultivated citrus. ( a ) Citrinae phylogeny and genomes. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. Asterisks indicate the de novo genomes sequenced in this study. Circles indicate previously published genomes.

The length of each line is based on the percentage of seed weight in the fruit. Scale bars, 1 cm. A high-quality and three draft genomes of Citrinae A high-quality genome of citrus was generated from haploid pummelo ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) by single-molecule sequencing. A total of 56.8× coverage of single-molecule sequences on the PacBio RS II platform via a shotgun approach was used for genome assembly ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Additionally, 370.3× Illumina sequencing data were used to correct sequencing errors and to fill in the gaps ( Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2 ). The contig N50 and N90 of the final assembly were 2.2 Mb and 70 kb, respectively. Moreover, the scaffold N50 and N90 were 4.2 Mb and 565 kb, respectively ( Table 1 ). The sequence contiguity represents 18-fold and a 44-fold improvements of the C. clementina and C. sinensis genomes, respectively, as evaluated by contig N50 (refs. 18 , 19 ). Ninety percent of the assembly is in 101 scaffolds larger than 565 kb. The largest scaffold is 14.3 Mb. A total of 117 scaffolds, accounting for 87% of the assembled genome, were anchored by 1,563 molecular markers ( Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7 and Supplementary Table 3 ). Table 1 Statistics for the genome assembly of haploid pummelo PacBio and Illumina PacBio only Illumina only Size of assembled contigs (bp) 344,871,569 342,313,257 315,873,942 Number of contigs (>300 bp) 2,602 2,287 11,265 Largest contig (bp) 10,624,441 10,610,371 1,033,078 Contig N50 (bp) 2,182,545 1,873,929 185,724 Contig N90 (bp) 70,069 37,177 32,069 Size of assembled scaffolds (bp) 345,744,738 – 331,715,129 Number of scaffolds (>300 bp) 1,612 – 4,706 Largest scaffold (bp) 14,289,975 – 9,046,907 Scaffold N50 (bp) 4,210,623 – 1,770,174 Scaffold N90 (bp) 565,389 – 302,743 N50 values of the genome assembly were calculated using sequences >300 bp. Three draft genomes of heterozygous Citrinae species—atalantia ( A. buxifolia , primitive citrus), papeda ( C. ichangensis , wild citrus) and citron ( C. medica ) ( Fig. 1a )—were sequenced and assembled with Illumina shotgun sequencing reads. High-coverage sequencing data that ranged from 164.4× to 401.9× were produced from multiple libraries, with small insert sizes that ranged from 140 bp to 500 bp and long insert sizes of 2 kb, 5 kb and 20 kb ( Supplementary Tables 4–6 ). The sequenced reads were assembled using the de Bruijn graph algorithm from the SOAPdenovo package 20 , resulting in scaffold N50 values of 1,074 kb, 504 kb and 367 kb (with contig N50 values of 23.9 kb, 76.6 kb and 46.5 kb) for atalantia, papeda and citron, respectively ( Supplementary Table 7 ). Ab initio gene prediction programs, homology searches and RNA-seq analysis were integrated to annotate the pummelo genome. We identified 30,123 protein-coding genes with 42,886 transcripts. The gene transcripts had an average length of 1,572 bp, a mean coding sequence size of 1,141 bp and an average exon length of 277 bp. RNA-seq data revealed that 12,763 gene loci (42.4%) encoded two or more transcriptional isoforms. Regarding the core and dispensable portions of these genomes, all of the genes in the six genomes (29,655 in sweet orange; 24,533 in clementine mandarin; 30,123 in pummelo; 32,579 in citron; 32,067 in papeda; 28,420 in atalantia) ( Supplementary Table 7 ) were classified into 23,829 gene families on the basis of the homology of their encoded proteins. A total of 12,457 (52%) gene families were shared by all six of these genomes ( Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 8 ). Further analysis indicated a similar number of genes in almost all of the transcription factor gene families in the six citrus genomes ( Supplementary Tables 9 and 10 ). Genomic characteristics of citrus The four sequenced species from this study (atalantia, papeda, citron and pummelo), and the two previously published sequenced species (sweet orange and clementine mandarin) 18 , 19 range from primitive to cultivated citrus ( Fig. 1 ). An overview of the genome synteny and sequence variation is presented in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figures 9–13 . The genome sizes are similar among the Citrus species. We observed the most variation in genome size between Atalantia and the Citrus species ( Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Note 2 ). On the basis of our presence–absence variation (PAV) analysis, 33.28% of the unique regions in pummelo (relative to atalantia) contained transposable elements (TEs), and 2.68% of the unique regions contained protein-coding genes ( Supplementary Table 12 ). Approximately one-fifth of the genes in the unique regions (153 of 780 annotated genes) of pummelo were predicted to have known functions. These genes were significantly enriched ( P value < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05) in three GO terms: defense response and proteolysis (biological process category) and pectate lyase activity (molecular function category) relative to the entire genome of pummelo ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ). Among the 153 genes with functional annotations, 93 are homologous to one or more genes (60.78%) ( Supplementary Table 13 ). Conversely, the unique regions in atalantia relative to pummelo had a higher TE content (54.20%) than the entire atalantia genome (43.55%). Figure 2 Characteristics of the citrus genomes. The distribution of the syntenic regions and the confident SNVs between the pummelo genome and the three genomes representing cultivated, wild and primitive citrus are shown. The lines in the center of the circle indicate pairs of homologous genes on the different chromosomes of pummelo. SNVs were confidently identified by sequence alignment ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ) and filtered using resequencing data. A pairwise comparison of each species versus pummelo showed that the transition/transversion ratios varied from 1.38 to 1.66, with an average of 1.57 ( Supplementary Table 14 ). The distributions of SNVs in gene structures displayed the highest density in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs (an average of 18.8 and 17.2 SNVs per kb for 5′ and 3′ UTRs, respectively). The second highest density of SNVs was in introns (an average of 14.2 SNVs per kb). The lowest density of SNVs was in coding sequence (CDS) regions (an average of 9.7 SNVs per kb) ( Supplementary Table 15 ). The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was calculated for each of the 8,551 single-copy orthologs shared by these six citrus genomes. We found that 207, 100, 104, 66, 106 and 77 genes showed higher dN/dS values in atalantia, papeda, citron, pummelo, clementine mandarin and sweet orange ( Supplementary Table 16 ), respectively, relative to other species. For the dN/dS of single-copy orthologous genes, 12.79% of the genes showed a value greater than one in atalantia ( Supplementary Table 17 ). This proportion was higher than the average value of 6.82% from other citrus ( Supplementary Tables 18–22 ), indicating greater sequence divergence in atalantia relative to other citrus. These genes may have functional associations with the biological features of atalantia. For instance, Cg4g018790 encodes a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase homologous to the rice OsCKX2 gene, which has been reported to control seed number 21 . In this gene, higher sequence polymorphisms were observed in atalantia relative to other citrus species ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Genetic diversity and comparative population analysis Citrinae species exhibit high levels of morphological diversity ( Fig. 3a ), which is a reflection of their diverse genetic backgrounds. We selected and sequenced 100 citrus accessions with an average depth of 30-fold genome coverage ( Supplementary Table 23 ). Sequencing data from three mandarins, one orange and four pummelos from previous studies 18 , 19 were also analyzed. This set of 108 citrus accessions ( Supplementary Fig. 17 ) was used for population diversity analysis, genetic differentiation analysis and association analysis of the apomixis trait. For comparative population analysis, 15 atalantia accessions, 11 papeda accessions and 19 pummelo accessions, representing primitive, wild and cultivated citrus, were used ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 18 ). The fixation index ( F ST ) values among these citrus populations fluctuated around 0.28 ( Supplementary Fig. 19 ), which indicates moderate genetic differentiations among citrus populations. For a comparison, the F ST was 0.34 between two wild populations of common bean and 0.44 between wild and cultivated cucumber 22 , 23 . Figure 3 Genetic diversity and population differentiation analysis of primitive, wild and cultivated citrus. ( a ) The diversity of citrus germplasms in this study. Inner circle, primitive citrus; middle circle, wild and cultivated citrus; outer circle, cultivated citrus. ( b ) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of 45 citrus accessions (15 atalantia, 11 papeda and 19 pummelo) used in the comparative population analysis. Bootstrap values are indicated in the tree. ( c ) The distribution of π along the chromosomes among the populations of atalantia, papeda and pummelo, respectively. These values were calculated in 2-Mb sliding windows with 1-Mb steps. ( d ) Distribution of the reduction of diversity (log 10 π ratios) and differentiation ( F ST values) from the pairwise comparison of the atalantia and pummelo populations. π ratios were calculated as π atalantia /π pummelo in 50-kb sliding windows with 10-kb steps. The region above the dashed line in the distribution of log 10 π ratios corresponds to the 5% right tail of the empirical distribution (log 10 π ratio = 0.36). The regions above the dashed line in the F ST values distribution are in the 5% right tail of the empirical distribution ( F ST is 0.40). Nucleotide diversity (π) analysis indicated that atalantia has the highest genetic diversity and that papeda has a higher level of genetic diversity than pummelo ( Fig. 3c ). We observed a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity between atalantia and papeda. Additional sequence analysis indicated that atalantia has more highly diverged regions (threefold more highly divergent regions, on average) than the other two populations ( Supplementary Table 24 ). For example, a long region at the end of chromosome 5 (39.64–49.38 Mb, about one-fifth of the chromosome) displayed the highest diversity in atalantia and a dramatic reduction in diversity in papeda and pummelo ( Fig. 3c ). Genomic regions that showed both high differentiation and reduced diversity were identified among the primitive, wild and cultivated citrus ( Supplementary Fig. 20 and Supplementary Tables 25–27 ). The results of pairwise comparisons indicated that the distribution of such regions was uneven along the chromosomes ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 21 ). On the basis of the pairwise comparison between atalantia and pummelo, we concluded that a total of 18.1 Mb of genomic regions, containing 2,430 genes, were probably under selection in pummelo ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 28 ). These regions include genes associated with vegetative growth, such as Cg7g021010, Cg4g017400 and Cg9g010410 , which are homologous to TCP15 (ref. 24 ), LAS 25 and YUCCA3 (ref. 26 ), respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 22 ). Notably, we observed a strong signal on chromosome 9, spanning 220 kb, from 13.8 Mb to 14.0 Mb ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 23 ) in the pummelo genome. Thirteen of the fifteen annotated genes in this region have functions related to cytochrome c biogenesis, mitochondrial proteins, ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins ( Supplementary Table 25 ). Comparative analysis also indicated that flowering-related genes, such as the gene encoding the WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) 27 transcription factor ( Cg4g011660 ; Supplementary Fig. 24 ) and the gene encoding the flowering time control protein FPA ( Cg2g027110 ; Supplementary Fig. 25 ), showed strongly reduced diversity and a high degree of differentiation. Therefore, we suggest that these genes were probably under selection. These regions were shown to harbor signals of selection as defined by recent studies 22 , 28 . The effect caused by other possibilities, such as genetic drift and bottlenecks 29 , could not be excluded but might be limited, as indicated by the similar pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) curve of these three populations ( Supplementary Fig. 26 ). FPA has a critical role in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis 30 . This finding is consistent with the observation that atalantia has a prolonged flowering season (from May to December) and that in contrast, the flowering season is synchronized among all of the other cultivated citrus. The genomic basis of citrus apomixis (nucellar polyembryony) The emergence of a particular type of apomixis, nucellar polyembryony, in mandarin and most cultivated varieties of citrus is one of the prominent features of the recent evolution of citrus ( Fig. 4a ). We scored the polyembryony phenotypes of 124 fruit-yielding progeny from a segregating population derived from a cross between HB pummelo (monoembryony) and Fairchild mandarin (polyembryony) that exhibited contrasting phenotypes ( Supplementary Table 29 ). For the bulk segregant analysis (BSA), the transformed Δ(SNP index) was calculated and plotted against the genomic sequence in 250-kb sliding windows with step sizes of 10 kb ( Fig. 4b ). The peak value for the transformed Δ(SNP index) was localized to a region spanning from 23.695 to 25.655 Mb on chromosome 4. These data indicated that this 1.96-Mb region harbors a major locus contributing to nucellar polyembryony. Figure 4 Genetic mapping of the citrus polyembryony. ( a ) The phenotype of citrus polyembryony. ( b ) Mapping the polyembryony by bulk segregant analysis (BSA) of a segregating population derived from HB pummelo × Fairchild mandarin cross. Red arrow indicates the position of the 1.96-Mb peak. The transformed Δ(SNP index) is the product of the Δ(SNP index) and normalized SNP density in each 250-kb sliding window (10-kb steps). ( c ) Gene-based local association analysis in the relevant region. Top, heat map for association levels in the relevant region. The −log 10 -transformed P (two-tailed Fisher's exact test) was calculated in each 50-kb sliding window (10-kb steps). Middle, the 80-kb candidate region with the strongest association. Regression line (red) and confidence intervals (gray) were calculated using a linear model at a confidence level of 0.95. Bottom, genes in the candidate region in diploid pummelo. Boxes represent genes; horizontal black line represents intergenic regions; vertical lines show positions of 5′ end of the genes. Genes annotated from the haploid pummelo genome are presented in Supplementary Figure 28 . To fine map the polyembryony locus, a local association analysis with the variant information from the protein-encoding genes in the 1.96 Mb region was performed using the genome sequencing data from the 108 aforementioned accessions, including 45 polyembryonic and 63 monoembryonic accessions ( Supplementary Table 23 ). We employed P values from the two-tailed Fisher's exact test to measure the correlations between nucleotide variation and phenotype ( Supplementary Fig. 27 ), which were adjusted with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing. This analysis localized the polyembryony locus to an ∼80-kb region on chromosome 4, between 24.54 and 24.62 Mb, that contains 11 genes ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 28 ). Consistent with this result, the population differentiation between the polyembryonic and monoembryonic accessions was substantially higher for this 80-kb region than the surrounding regions ( Supplementary Fig. 29 ). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) among polyembryonic accessions was larger than the LD among monoembryonic accessions ( Supplementary Fig. 29 ), which indicates a selection signature between monoembryonic and polyembryonic citrus. Among the 11 candidate genes, Cg4g018910 and Cg4g018970 showed the highest association with the polyembryony phenotype ( Fig. 5a ). Expression analysis of all candidate genes indicated that Cg4g018970 was highly expressed in ovules and specifically expressed in polyembryonic citrus cultivars but not in monoembryonic citrus cultivars ( Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Fig. 30 ). Cg4g018970 encodes a RWP-RK domain–containing protein similar to the Arabidopsis RKD family of proteins, which serve as regulators of egg cell–related genes 31 . Thus, we hereafter refer to Cg4g018970 as CitRWP . A sequence alignment of CitRWP from polyembryonic and monoembryonic citrus identified four SNPs in the gene sequence and an insertion of a miniature inverted-repeat TE (MITE) in the promoter region (g.24610316_24610317ins(203) in chromosome 4 in the reference of pummelo genome (MKYQ00000000)) ( Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 31 ). To test whether this transposon is linked to the polyembryony locus, we screened the 124 fruit-yielding individuals from the segregating population of 217 progeny derived from an HB pummelo × Fairchild mandarin cross. We did not find this MITE insertion in any of the monoembryonic progeny ( n = 66). In contrast, we found the MITE insertion in all of the polyembryonic progeny ( n = 58) ( Supplementary Fig. 32 ). Thus, we conclude that this MITE insertion is associated with the polyembryony locus. Next, we used a germplasm collection containing 786 accessions of citrus to independently test this association. Consistent with our results, we found this MITE insertion in all of the polyembryonic accessions ( n = 213). In contrast, all the monoembryonic accessions ( n = 573) lack this particular MITE insertion ( Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Table 30 ). Figure 5 Candidate genes associated with citrus polyembryony.

Transcriptome of sexual and nucellar embryos from citrus To investigate the molecular processes and genes involved in sexual and nucellar embryogenesis in citrus, we compared the RNA-seq data derived from leaves, ovules, fruits and seeds of pummelo (sexual type) and sweet orange (asexual type). We found that 1,637 and 1,840 genes were highly expressed in ovules (≥2-fold higher than in other tissues) of pummelo and sweet orange, respectively ( Fig. 6a and Supplementary Tables 31 and 32 ). We found that 853 of these genes were highly expressed in both pummelo and sweet orange. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the genes associated with microtubule-based movement, DNA packaging, cell cycle, DNA replication, mitosis and transcription regulator activity were over-represented among the genes that were highly expressed in ovules ( Supplementary Table 33 ). The genes that were highly expressed in the ovules of sweet orange were significantly (P < 0.05; FDR < 0.05) enriched in almost the same gene ontologies as the group of 853 genes that were highly expressed in the ovules of both pummelo and sweet orange, such as regulation of transcription, mitosis, nuclear division and mitotic cell cycle, which contribute to cell division ( Supplementary Table 34 ). These data highlight similarities in the transcriptomes of nucellar and sexual embryos. Figure 6 Comparative transcriptome analysis of monoembryonic and polyembryonic citrus. ( a ) Heat map of genes that are specifically expressed in ovules of both pummelo (monoembryony) and sweet orange (polyembryony). Leaf, ovule, fruit and seed tissues from pummelo (odd numbers) and sweet orange (even numbers) were used for the comparative analysis. ( b ) Heat map of the genes with significantly different expression in the ovules of monoembryonic (PML, pummelo; CTR, citron; CLM, clementine mandarin) and polyembryonic cultivars (GRP, grapefruit; LM, lemon; PK, ponkan). Data are derived from 2 replicates of plant tissue. Normalized FPKM values after scaling and centering are shown. ( c ) Model for genes that are involved in monoembryony and polyembryony, including the candidate gene CitRWP (yellow star). Blue dots indicate genes highly expressed in ovules and showed no significant difference in expression between monoembryonic and polyembryonic citrus cultivars ( Supplementary Tables 36 and 37 ). Red dots indicate genes highly expressed in the ovules of polyembryonic citrus cultivars. M, megaspore mother cell; ES, embryo sac; N, nucellar embryo initiation cell. To identify genes that are differentially expressed between polyembryony and monoembryony, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed on the ovules from three pairs of monoembryonic and polyembryonic citrus cultivars (pummelo–grapefruit, citron–lemon, clementine–ponkan) at the key stage of nucellar embryo initiation (i.e., 3 d before anthesis) 14 , 15 . Considering the genetic differences between each pair of citrus cultivars, we performed a pairwise comparison of the three pairs of RNA-seq data. Among the 2,624 genes that were preferentially expressed in the ovules of pummelo and sweet orange, 29 showed markedly different (≥2-fold) expression levels between each pair of monoembryonic and polyembryonic cultivars ( Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 35 ). The annotation of these genes and analysis of homologous Arabidopsis sequences indicated that 11 of the 29 genes encode proteins with unknown function. Almost half of the remaining genes were associated with the biological processes of stress response ( RNS1, ATSOD1, Cg4g011120 and Cg9g004560 ) and oxidation reduction ( ATBBE18 and Cg3g004030 ). Three additional genes ( EDA24, AGL2 and ACR4 ) contribute to flower and embryo development in Arabidopsis and other plants 32 , 33 , 34 . These genes are expressed in the ovules of both monoembryonic and polyembryonic cultivars and are expressed at dramatically higher levels in polyembryonic cultivars. CitRWP shows a similar expression trend in polyembryonic cultivars, which is consistent with our conclusion, from genetic analysis, that CitRWP is the key candidate gene controlling polyembryony ( Fig. 6c and Supplementary Tables 36 and 37 ). Discussion We sequenced and assembled one high-quality genome and three draft genomes of Citrinae species. The haploid pummelo genome represents the most contiguous citrus genome assembly to date. The sequence contiguity (contig N50) of the long reads assembly using PacBio data is at least 18-fold higher than that of recently published citrus genomes 18 , 19 . The shotgun approach using PacBio single-molecule sequencing in combination with Illumina data is effective and efficient for a de novo genome assembly. This high-quality pummelo genome together with the three draft genomes of citron, papeda and atalantia constitute a valuable platform for citrus genetic and genomic research. Change in the reproductive system is one of the striking features in the evolution and domestication of fruit crops 35 . Consistent with this observation, the sequence analysis of the six genomes that included primitive, wild and cultivated citrus indicated frequent variations in flowering- and seed-related genes, such as CKX 21 . The comparative population analysis of these species indicated that mitochondria- and reproduction-associated genes, such as WOX 27 and FPA 30 , are probably under selection in cultivated citrus. Apomixis has received considerable attention because of its capability to permanently fix valuable traits and hybrid genotypes (hybrid vigor). It is possible that apomixis was used inadvertently during the history of citrus breeding and selection. When desirable variations and traits were observed, the apomictic lines tended to have a greater chance of being selected, maintained and dispersed. This may also explain why most of the commercial and elite citrus are apomictic. In this study, we provided a comprehensive analysis of citrus apomixis (polyembryony) using genetic, genomic and transcriptomic approaches. The segregation ratios of both the phenotype and genotype in a segregating F 1 population are consistent with the single dominant gene model for nucellar embryony 9 . The cosegregation of the MITE insertion in the promoter region of CitRWP with the polyembryonic phenotype lends more support to the single dominant mutation model for the emergence of apomixis in mandarin. Our genomic analysis localized the candidate region to an 80-kb interval containing 11 genes, which was embedded in a 380-kb region reported by a previous study 12 . In this interval, we identified a promising candidate gene for the single dominant allele responsible for polyembryony in citrus. Notably, this candidate gene, CitRWP , is specifically expressed in ovules and at higher levels in polyembryonic cultivars. A gene harboring the same domain, AtRKD4 ( GROUNDED ), was reported to promote embryogenesis in somatic cells when transiently overexpressed 36 , 37 . Fully elucidating the contribution of CitRWP to apomixis will require knocking out CitRWP in citrus. Our transcriptome analyses provide global insights into the molecular processes involved in the development of sexual and asexual (nucellar) embryos in citrus. The results indicate a close developmental relationship between sexual reproduction and apomixis in citrus, which is consistent with a report on apomictic Boechera gunnisoniana 38 . The unusually high expression of three sexual embryogenesis–associated genes during apomixis ( AGL2, EDA24 and ACR4 ) provides more support for the notion that nucellar embryogenesis and sexual reproduction may utilize similar genes or pathways. Previous studies reported that extreme stress induces the initiation of autonomous embryo development in somatic cells in response to exogenous or endogenous signals 39 . Here we identified six nucellar embryo-associated genes that are regulated by stress, which is in agreement with a previous report on apomixis in Hieracium praealtum 40 . This genomic information on primitive, wild and cultivated citrus may also be valuable for the future analysis of metabolism and to further investigate the basis of historical uses of citrus species. For example, C. medica was historically used for medicinal purposes, and atalantia was also used as a traditional medicinal plant for folk medicines aiming to treat malaria, chronic rheumatism, paralysis and snakebites 41 . Additionally, wild and primitive citrus, which have been largely neglected during the history of citrus breeding, exhibit higher genetic diversity that is useful for managing disease in cultivated citrus with narrow genetic backgrounds resulting from apomixis, clonal propagation and human selection. Future characterization and utilization of genes controlling apomixis, metabolism, disease resistance and other agriculturally important traits is a promising path for the improvement of crop breeding. Methods Plant materials. A total of 100 citrus accessions ( Supplementary Table 23 ) were sequenced in this study. The germplasm containing 786 citrus accessions ( Supplementary Table 30 ) was collected at the National Citrus Breeding Center, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China, and the Citrus Experiment Stations from the MATS program of the Ministry of Agriculture of China. The haploid pummelo was obtained from the Citrus Research Institute, Southwest University, Chongqing, China ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The segregating population derived from the HB pummelo × Fairchild mandarin cross comprises 217 individuals including 124 fruit-bearing progeny ( Supplementary Table 29 ). The population was created in 2004 and began flowering in 2012 at the National Citrus Breeding Center, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. De novo assembly and annotation of four citrus genomes. For the haploid C. grandis , 30 cells of PacBio data (56.8 × genome coverage) and 141 Gb of Illumina data (370.3 × genome coverage; Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 38 ) containing both short and long inserts were used. For the assembly of haploid pummelo genome, the PacBio long reads were corrected and assembled using the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP) 42 in SMRT Analysis (v2.3.0). Another round of polishing was performed with Quiver 42 to further improve the quality of the assembled contigs. Next, mate-paired reads corrected by Quake 43 were used in scaffolding with the SSPACE-STANDARD package 44 , and GapCloser 20 was used to fill the gaps with all of the Illumina reads. Then, the SSPACE-STANDARD package was used to further extend the gap-filled scaffolds. To improve the completeness of the assembly, long contigs assembled only with Illumina reads were aligned to the PacBio-based assembly, and the unaligned sequences were added to the final assembly ( Supplementary Note 3 ). For the heterozygous diploid A. buxifolia, C. ichangensis and C. medica , short-insert (i.e., insert sizes ranging from 140 bp to 500 bp) and long-insert (i.e., insert sizes of 2, 5, and 20 kb) DNA libraries were constructed (Illumina) ( Supplementary Tables 4–6 and 38 ). In total, 131.9 Gb (∼401.9× genome coverage), 64.3 Gb (∼164.4× genome coverage), and 69.5 Gb (∼170.9× genome coverage) of raw data were generated for A. buxifolia, C. ichangensis and C. medica , respectively. The draft genomes were assembled using SOAPdenovo 20 with Illumina reads corrected using QUAKE. Then, all the reads were aligned onto the contigs for scaffolding, and the GapCloser package was used to fill the gaps. For the atalantia genome, the 3.73 Gb PacBio reads were corrected using the Illumina reads and were then used to improve the assembly. For the annotation of each of the four genomes, the TEs were masked and the annotation was performed ab initio by integrating the evidence from sequence homology and transcriptomic data ( Supplementary Notes 4–6 and Supplementary Table 39 ). Phylogenetic tree of Citrinae. The coding region sequences from 103 single-copy genes 18 were concatenated ( Supplementary Data Set 1 ), constrained to their amino acid sequences and used for tree construction. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was produced with Clausena as the outgroup using the substitution model GTRGAMMA of the RAxML software 45 . A total of 1,000 rapid bootstrap inferences were performed. Detection of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and presence–absence variations (PAVs). The six citrus genomes ( A. buxifolia, C. ichangensis, C. medica, C. grandis, C. clementina and C. sinensis ) were used for comparison and synteny analyses. The differences between pairs of genomes were found using the Nucmer program in the MUMmer software 46 with the default parameters. Alignment results of the five query genome sequences ( A. buxifolia, C. ichangensis, C. medica, C. clementina and C. sinensis ) against the reference genome of C. grandis were used to extract SNVs, PAVs and indels (insertions and deletions), which were further filtered and validated with re-sequencing data. In addition, the enrichment analysis for genes in the unique regions was performed using agriGO 47 against the background of the corresponding whole genome ( Supplementary Note 7 ). Genomic characterization of six citrus genomes. Protein-encoding genes from A. buxifolia, C. ichangensis, C. medica, C. grandis, C. clementina and C. sinensis were compared using BLASTP 48 with an E -value cutoff of 1 × 10 −10 and clustered using OrthoMCL 49 . The results of all-by-all BLASTP was used to estimate the synteny for pairs of citrus genomes with the i-ADHoRe software 50 . The gene family members in each genome were identified using the HMMER software 51 , on the basis of the domain profiles of 62 transcription factor families, 22 groups of transcriptional regulators collected in the PlnTFDB database (see URLs ) and the NB-ARC domain (PF00931) from Pfam (see URLs ). The domains of the proteins encoded by the members of the MADS-box ( Supplementary Data Set 2 ) and NBS-related genes were manually checked using PROSITE (see URLs ). The MADS-box and NBS-related genes were classified ( Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34 ). The dN/dS values were calculated for each of the 8,551 single-copy orthologous genes shared by the six citrus genomes using the codeml program in PAML 52 with the one-ratio branch model and the free-ratios branch model. Using a likelihood ratio test, the values of dN/dS for each single-copy orthologous gene were determined and the fast-evolving single-copy orthologous genes were identified for each citrus genome ( P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05). Genetic diversity and F ST analysis. A total of 100 citrus accessions were sequenced on the Illumina platform with an average depth of 30-fold genome coverage ( Supplementary Table 23 ). In addition, we used sequence data from three mandarins, one orange and four pummelos from previous studies 18 , 19 for our analysis. The paired-end data were aligned to the pummelo reference genome using BWA 53 . Population-based SNP calling was performed using SAMtools 54 . To evaluate the relationships among the 108 accessions, a neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the maximum composite likelihood method in MEGA5 software 55 with 1,000 bootstrap test (data in Supplementary Data Set 3 ). The shotgun genome sequencing data of 15 atalantia, 11 papeda and 19 pummelo were used to represent primitive, wild and cultivated citrus. The SNPs located in the regions of single-copy orthologous genes shared by the six citrus genomes were used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the substitution model GTRGAMMA of the maximum likelihood method with the RAxML software ( Supplementary Data Set 4 ). For genetic diversity and selection signature analysis, SNPs of the whole genome were used, and a sliding-window approach (50-kb windows sliding in 10-kb steps) was employed to quantify genetic differentiation ( F ST ) and nucleotide diversity (π) for each pair of citrus populations using the VCFtools software 56 . Values of π were also calculated in 2-Mb sliding windows with steps sizes of 1 Mb. To detect the selection signatures, the log 10 π ratio was calculated. The regions with significantly high F ST values (in the 5% right tail of the empirical distribution of F ST values) and significant reduction in diversity (in the 5% right tail of the empirical distribution of log 10 π ratio) were considered to be under selection ( Supplementary Note 8 ). Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) and pool sequencing. Two DNA pools from 20 individuals exhibiting extreme monoembryonic and polyembryonic phenotypes were collected from a population derived from an HB pummelo × Fairchild mandarin cross ( Supplementary Table 29 ). Sequencing was performed at tenfold and 60-fold depth for parents and DNA pools, respectively ( Supplementary Table 40 ). Reads from the parents and from the monoembryonic and polyembryonic pools were separately mapped to the pummelo genome using BWA (mapping quality > 30). The SAMtools software was used for SNP calling (Q > 30). According to the genotypes of HB pummelo (monoembryonic, pp ) and Fairchild mandarin (polyembryonic, Pp ), the allelic nucleotide polymorphisms fitting Pp in the polyembryonic pool and pp in the monoembryonic pool were identified. The sites were retained if they fit the following criteria: p % of the monoembryonic pool ≥ 0.9 and 0.4 ≤ p % ≤ 0.6 in the polyembryonic pool. The absolute value of their difference was calculated as a Δ(SNP index). Using the sliding-window approach, the average Δ(SNP index) and max–min normalized SNP density were calculated with 250-kb sliding windows with 10-kb step sizes. The final transformed Δ(SNP index) was the product of the average Δ(SNP index) and the normalized SNP density. Local gene-based association analysis for the polyembryony locus. The candidate polyembryony interval of 1.96 Mb was extracted from the genome sequences of atalantia, papeda, citron, sweet orange, and clementine mandarin by separately searching each genome with BLASTN. BWA was used to align the sequencing reads from the 108 accessions to the corresponding target sequences. The reads of each accession that mapped to the 1.96 Mb region were identified using the bam2fastq software (see URLs ). These reads were remapped to gene sequences using the pummelo candidate regions as templates. After using iCORN2 (ref. 57 ) to substitute SNPs and small indels (1–3 bp), we obtained 292 gene sequences in the candidate region of each accession. For each of the 292 genes in the candidate region, a multiple sequence alignment of homologous sequences from 108 accessions was performed using ClustalW 58 . For each polymorphic site, the P value from the two-tailed Fisher's exact test was calculated to quantify the associations between the nucleotide polymorphisms and the polyembryonic trait. The P values were adjusted using the FDR correction for multiple testing. The sites were retained if they fit the criteria of P < 0.01 and FDR < 0.01 ( Supplementary Note 9 ). For the 11 candidate genes in the 80-kb region, all of the SNPs in the gene sequence from the 108 accessions were extracted and analyzed. For each SNP, the proportion of the accessions in which the genotype of the site was associated with the phenotype of the embryo was regarded as an association score. The SNPs with association scores greater than 80% were used for further SNP association analysis ( Fig. 5a ). MITE marker development. The 203-bp MITE insertion is located on chromosome 4 of the pummelo genome between nucleotides 24,610,316 and 24,610,317, which is in the promoter region of CitRWP . Two pairs of primers ('mite_p1' and 'mite_p2', Supplementary Table 41 ) were designed. Primer pair 'mite_p1' contains degenerate nucleotide to be used for the broad germplasm of 786 accessions. Primer pair 'mite_p2' was specifically designed to be used for the progeny from the HB pummelo × Fairchild mandarin cross. Both the primer pairs anneal approximately 100 bp upstream (forward primer) and 200 bp downstream (reversed primer) of the MITE insertion site ( Supplementary Note 10 ). We performed a PCR-based screen to detect the MITE insertion. PCR was carried out in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 10 μl of 2× Taq Plus Mix (Vazyme Biotech), 100 ng genome template, 0.2 mM of each forward and reverse primer. The amplification was done at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C, and finally 5 min at 72 °C. Transcriptome sequencing and analysis. A total of 26 samples from leaves, ovules, fruits, and seeds were harvested for RNA-seq analysis. Two replicates of plant tissue were analyzed. RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer platform. An average of 4 Gb data were generated for each sample ( Supplementary Table 42 ). The RNA-seq reads were aligned to the pummelo genome sequences using TopHat 59 . The expression level of each predicted transcript in each RNA-seq library was calculated as the FPKM with Cufflinks 60 . Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the web-based agriGO program with the default parameters ( P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Tables 33, 34 and 43 and Supplementary Note 11 ). Quantitative PCR analysis. Total RNA from all the tissues was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Takara). cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg total RNA and the HiScript II QRT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, R223-01). qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7900 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Mastermix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kapa, RR420). The cycling conditions included incubation for 3 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 35 s). Using the citrus β-actin gene as the internal reference gene, relative gene expression values were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method 61 . The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 41 . Statistical analyses. We used the Fisher's exact test to conduct the GO enrichment analysis of the target genes relative to the background of the corresponding entire genome using agriGO program. The likelihood ratio test was used to determine the branch model during the dN/dS analysis using PAML program. The two-tailed Fisher's exact tests were used to quantify the associations between the nucleotide polymorphisms and the polyembryonic trait. Moreover, all the P values from the tests mentioned above were adjusted using the FDR correction for multiple testing. The filtering criteria of P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05 were given for the analysis of GO enrichment analysis and likelihood ratio test, and the filtering criteria were P < 0.01 and FDR < 0.01 for the associations analysis of citrus polyembryony.

In addition, we used sequence data from three mandarins, one orange and four pummelos from previous studies 18 , 19 for our analysis. The paired-end data were aligned to the pummelo reference genome using BWA 53 . Population-based SNP calling was performed using SAMtools 54 . To evaluate the relationships among the 108 accessions, a neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the maximum composite likelihood method in MEGA5 software 55 with 1,000 bootstrap test (data in Supplementary Data Set 3 ).

The candidate polyembryony interval of 1.96 Mb was extracted from the genome sequences of atalantia, papeda, citron, sweet orange, and clementine mandarin by separately searching each genome with BLASTN. BWA was used to align the sequencing reads from the 108 accessions to the corresponding target sequences. The reads of each accession that mapped to the 1.96 Mb region were identified using the bam2fastq software (see URLs ). These reads were remapped to gene sequences using the pummelo candidate regions as templates. After using iCORN2 (ref. 57 ) to substitute SNPs and small indels (1–3 bp), we obtained 292 gene sequences in the candidate region of each accession. For each of the 292 genes in the candidate region, a multiple sequence alignment of homologous sequences from 108 accessions was performed using ClustalW 58 . For each polymorphic site, the P value from the two-tailed Fisher's exact test was calculated to quantify the associations between the nucleotide polymorphisms and the polyembryonic trait. The P values were adjusted using the FDR correction for multiple testing. The sites were retained if they fit the criteria of P < 0.01 and FDR < 0.01 ( Supplementary Note 9 ). For the 11 candidate genes in the 80-kb region, all of the SNPs in the gene sequence from the 108 accessions were extracted and analyzed. For each SNP, the proportion of the accessions in which the genotype of the site was associated with the phenotype of the embryo was regarded as an association score. The SNPs with association scores greater than 80% were used for further SNP association analysis ( Fig. 5a ). MITE marker development. The 203-bp MITE insertion is located on chromosome 4 of the pummelo genome between nucleotides 24,610,316 and 24,610,317, which is in the promoter region of CitRWP . Two pairs of primers ('mite_p1' and 'mite_p2', Supplementary Table 41 ) were designed. Primer pair 'mite_p1' contains degenerate nucleotide to be used for the broad germplasm of 786 accessions. Primer pair 'mite_p2' was specifically designed to be used for the progeny from the HB pummelo × Fairchild mandarin cross. Both the primer pairs anneal approximately 100 bp upstream (forward primer) and 200 bp downstream (reversed primer) of the MITE insertion site ( Supplementary Note 10 ). We performed a PCR-based screen to detect the MITE insertion. PCR was carried out in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 10 μl of 2× Taq Plus Mix (Vazyme Biotech), 100 ng genome template, 0.2 mM of each forward and reverse primer. The amplification was done at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C, and finally 5 min at 72 °C. Transcriptome sequencing and analysis. A total of 26 samples from leaves, ovules, fruits, and seeds were harvested for RNA-seq analysis. Two replicates of plant tissue were analyzed. RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer platform. An average of 4 Gb data were generated for each sample ( Supplementary Table 42 ). The RNA-seq reads were aligned to the pummelo genome sequences using TopHat 59 . The expression level of each predicted transcript in each RNA-seq library was calculated as the FPKM with Cufflinks 60 . Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the web-based agriGO program with the default parameters ( P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Tables 33, 34 and 43 and Supplementary Note 11 ). Quantitative PCR analysis. Total RNA from all the tissues was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Takara). cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg total RNA and the HiScript II QRT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, R223-01). qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7900 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Mastermix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kapa, RR420). The cycling conditions included incubation for 3 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 35 s). Using the citrus β-actin gene as the internal reference gene, relative gene expression values were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method 61 . The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 41 . Statistical analyses. We used the Fisher's exact test to conduct the GO enrichment analysis of the target genes relative to the background of the corresponding entire genome using agriGO program. The likelihood ratio test was used to determine the branch model during the dN/dS analysis using PAML program. The two-tailed Fisher's exact tests were used to quantify the associations between the nucleotide polymorphisms and the polyembryonic trait. Moreover, all the P values from the tests mentioned above were adjusted using the FDR correction for multiple testing. The filtering criteria of P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05 were given for the analysis of GO enrichment analysis and likelihood ratio test, and the filtering criteria were P < 0.01 and FDR < 0.01 for the associations analysis of citrus polyembryony

2025-10-28 16:14:11,240 - INFO - Using prompt: Extract all genotype and NCBI accession information from the scientific article below. You MUST follow these steps:

        STEP 1 - SYSTEMATIC READING:
        Read the ENTIRE article text carefully, section by section:
        - Abstract: Check for study overview and organism mentions
        - Introduction: Look for study context and varieties being investigated
        - Materials and Methods: PRIMARY source for genotypes and sample descriptions
        - Results: Check for any additional genotype details or data references
        - Discussion: May contain references to data deposition
        - Data Availability Statement: CRITICAL section for NCBI accessions
        - Supplementary Information references: Note what information is external
        - Acknowledgments: Sometimes contains data repository information
        - TABLES: Pay special attention to tables (often formatted with pipes |, dashes -, or aligned columns). Tables frequently contain:
            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context
        - LOW: Ambiguous mentions, incomplete information, or indirect references

        STEP 5 - SOURCE TRACKING:
        - "main text": Information in the primary article body
        - "supplementary file": Referenced in supplementary materials (but actual content not in provided text)
        - "data availability statement": In data/code availability sections
        - "methods appendix": In detailed methods/materials sections
        - "not found": Information explicitly missing from the document

        STEP 6 - REASONING OUTPUT (MANDATORY):
        Before generating the final JSON, you MUST output your reasoning process in plain text using this format:

        FULL TEXT
Background Citrus blight, a citrus tree overall decline disease caused by unknown agent, was first described over 100 years ago [ 1 ]. This disease normally occurs in hot and humid citrus-producing areas, including North America, the Caribbean, South America, South Africa and Australia. The typical blight symptoms include zinc deficiency in the leaves, twig die back and overall tree decline [ 2 – 5 ]. Expression of p12 and blockage of xylem tissues are always associated with blight trees [ 2 – 5 ]. Consequently, antibody against p12 and reduced water uptake into the trunk due to the xylem blockage are widely used for diagnosis of citrus blight [ 6 , 7 ]. The causal agent of citrus blight remains unknown. The symptoms and characteristics associated with citrus blight can be reproduced by root graft inoculations but not by grafting canopy branches or by soil replacement, suggesting that citrus blight is caused by a systemic infectious agent, and the causal agent is restricted to the roots, as reviewed by Derrick and Timmer [ 5 ]. However, several observations found the disease spreading behavior fits a linear model, similar to abiotic abnormalities [ 5 ]. Multiple plant pathogens, such as Xylella fastidiosa [ 8 ], Fusarium solani [ 9 , 10 ] and idaeovirus [ 11 ], as well as some abiotic factors, such as nitrogen nutrients [ 12 ], were hypothesized as causal agents of citrus blight, but none have been confirmed [ 5 ]. Plants have integrative signaling and response networks to adapt themselves to the ever-changing environments. For example, when facing drought stress, metabolism is reprogrammed, and the synthesis and signaling pathways of ABA are activated [ 13 , 14 ]. When attacked by pathogens, plant immune responses are triggered, leading to dramatic changes in host transcriptional responses. Distinct features of host responses have been reported in response to infection by different pathogens or abiotic stresses [ 15 , 16 ]. Therefore, investigation of the host transcription response will deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of citrus blight. In a previous study, cDNA subtractive hybridization was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the roots of healthy and blighted rough lemon ( Citrus jambhiri Lush) rootstock supporting sweet orange ( C. sinensis ). However, genome sequence was unavailable for citrus when this study was performed in 2004. Thus, little information was gained in this previous study [ 17 ]. Recently, the genomes of sweet orange ( C. sinensis ) and clementine mandarin ( C. clementina ) have been sequenced and assembled into draft genomes [ 18 , 19 ], which facilitate the assembly and annotation of newly sequenced closely related citrus species. In addition, RNA-seq-based next-generation sequencing allows unprecedented opportunities to identify novel transcripts [ 20 ]. Thus, we aimed to revisit the citrus blight with the aid of the citrus genome sequences and next generation sequencing technologies. The draft genome of Swingle citrumelo, a very important rootstock in Florida [ 21 ], was sequenced, assembled and used as reference for RNA-seq analysis. More than 4000 differential expressed genes were identified using Tophat-Cufflinks-Cuffdiff pipeline [ 22 ], and their association with the citrus blight disease development and adaption was explored. Understanding the pathophysiology of citrus blight will provide hints for novel disease management and disease-resistant breeding improvement. Results Overview of the Swingle citrumelo draft assembly and annotation The rootstock used in this study, Swingle citrumelo, is a hybrid from Citrus paradisi Macf. X Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. (synonym: Citrus × paradisi × Citrus trifoliate , NCBI taxonomy ID: 309804 ) [ 23 ]. It formed a separate phylogenetic clade from the two published citrus genomes (see Additional file 1 : note 4 and Figure S1). To obtain a reliable reference genome for the RNA-seq analysis, the Swingle citrumelo draft genome was assembled based on a reference-assisted approach. A total of 69,656,379 × 2 trimmed high quality pair-end DNA reads (13.6 Gigabases (Gb)), from sample 23_11 were subjected for assembling using CLC genomic workbench v6.0.1 (CLC Bio). The assembly produced by word size 33 contained 720.2 K contigs with average contig length 669 bp with a total length of 482 Mb. After removing low credential contigs (average coverage lower than 6) and non-citrus originated contigs, 136,559 scaffolds affiliated with citrus were combined together, scaffolded and gap filled as mentioned in supplementary files. The resulting assembly length was 280.6 Mb, which covered about 74 % of the estimated swingle genome (380 Mb per 1C genome) (0.788 pg/2C) [ 24 ]. The average coverage was approximately 15X. The assembly has been deposited in NCBI under accession no. AZHM00000000. The detailed assembly information was listed in Table 1 . Table 1 Overview of the draft assembly of Swingle citrumelo Estimated genome size (Mb) 380 Genome assembly length (Mb) 280.6 Estimated coverage (%) 74 Number of scaffolds (≥500 bp) 66,319 Largest scaffold (kb) 234 N50 length (kb) 11.4 GC content (%) 34.44 N's length (Mb) 14 Repetitive element length (Mb) 44.8 Gene number 29,054 In total, 446 (97.4 %) of the 458 Core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) were identified in the assembly, and 97.8 % and 96.3 % of the 7954 swingle ESTs were aligned to the assembly using sim4db and exonerate, respectively, suggesting the draft assembly has a high coverage of coding sequences. A total of 44.8 Mb (16.8 % of 280.6 Mb) of repetitive elements were identified in the draft assembly using RepeatMasker, generating a 235.8 Mb repeat-masked assembly for gene prediction. Following two cycles of MAKER run, 29,054 genes were predicted without detection of alternative splicing forms (see Additional file 1 : note 3). This version of annotation was used as reference for RNA-seq analysis. Overview of the RNA-seq data A total of 725 million high-quality, paired-end reads (approximately 91.8 % of the total raw reads) were generated from the seven root samples from healthy and blight trees after trimming using CLC genomic workbench V6.0.1 (CLC Bio), with 100.8 to 117.6 million reads from each sample. A total of 505.69 million reads (69.8 % of trimmed reads) could be mapped uniquely to one location within the draft assembly, whereas an additional 6.69 million reads (0.9 %) were mapped to multiple locations within the draft assembly (Table 2 ). Table 2 Overview of mapped RNA-seq reads using Tophat2 Sample Trimmed reads (million) Unique mapping reads (million) Multi-mapping reads (million) Percentage of mapped reads (%) 14_14 117.6 82.61 1.13 71.6 16_11 100.8 70.51 0.97 70.9 20_2 91 60.85 0.77 67.7 18_7 98.8 70.31 0.90 72.1 20_6 105 72.12 1.00 69.6 23_11 107.8 76.01 1.01 71.4 24_8 104.6 73.28 0.91 70.9 Note: the data was calculated by RSeQC ver2.3.6 [ 62 ] Transcriptome analysis of roots of healthy and blight trees The variation between the seven samples was assessed using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot based on the overall gene expression profiles prior to differential expression analysis. In the MDS plot, the two healthy trees (20_6 and 24_8) formed a group, the two blight trees (14_14 and 16_11) clustered closely, and the two pre-blight trees (18_7 and 23_11) and the late blight stage tree (20_2) stood alone and were separated from the other trees (Additional file 1 : Figure S2). Specifically, the healthy trees remained healthy in a two-year duration, whereas the pre-blight trees showed no obvious blight symptoms at the beginning, but were diagnosed as blight later, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, the causal agent of Huanglongbing was also detected in sample 18_7 but not in other samples. Plant gene expression can be affected by many factors. The seven samples were collected from the same citrus grove under the same agricultural practices to minimize influence of environmental factors on the differential gene expression between blight and healthy trees. In addition, to rule out the possibility of differential gene expression caused by genetic difference, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the seven samples. SNPs were called by mapping DNA reads from all seven samples to the Swingle citrumelo assembly. The phylogenetic tree revealed the seven samples were nearly identical (Additional file 1 : Figure S1). Among the first 10,000 SNP sites, 9995 sites were identical for all seven samples, further demonstrating the samples used were from nucellar seedlings. Thus the possibility of genomic background difference caused by zygotic seedlings was ruled out. To investigate the differential gene expression between blight and healthy samples, we focused on the two healthy trees (20_6 and 24_8) and two blight trees (14_14 and 16_11), which had more consistent intragroup expression profiles. The two pre-blight samples were not closely grouped, thus eliminated from further analysis due to lack of replication (Additional file 1 : Figure S2C). Using a stringent cutoff: 2-fold change, q-value ≤ 0.05 and FPKM ≥1, 4440 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 2383 down-regulated genes and 2057 up-regulated genes (blight vs. healthy), were identified (Additional file 2 ). The metabolism pathways overview In the down-regulated genes in blight trees, metabolism related GO SLIM terms were enriched, including “biosynthetic process, GO:0009058”, “catabolic process, GO:0009056”, “lipid metabolic process, GO:0006629”, “carbohydrate metabolic process, GO:0005975”, “secondary metabolic process, GO:0019748” and “cellular protein modification process, GO:0006464” (Table 3 ). Further analysis using MapMan indicated that the DEGs involved in the TCA cycle, mitochondrial electron transport, and nitrogen assimilation, and most of the DEGs involved in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, secondary metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, were down-regulated in blight trees (Fig. 1 ). The down-regulation of metabolism genes is consistent with the decline of blight trees.

The figure was generated using MapMan software. Blue denotes down-regulated genes, and red denotes up-regulated genes. The log2-fold change in the transcript levels was used for the analysis Although most of the metabolic pathways showed reduced transcription activity in blight trees, the GO term “starch metabolic process, GO:0005982” was enriched with up-regulated genes under blight conditions (Table 3 ). Furthermore, the MapMan analysis demonstrated that a small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (XLOC_004663), which catalyzes the first step of starch synthesis, three starch synthases (XLOC_055628, XLOC_021153, XLOC_004226) and a starch branching enzyme (XLOC_011216) were up-regulated in blight trees. Numerous genes encoding enzymes involved in starch degradation, including starch cleavage and disproportionation, were also up-regulated in blight trees. A gene encoding sucrose phosphate synthase, responsible for sucrose synthesis, was up-regulated, whereas multiple genes involved in sucrose degradation pathways were down-regulated in blight trees (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Differentially expressed genes associated with starch and sucrose metabolism (blight vs. healthy). The figure was generated using MapMan software. Blue denotes down-regulated genes, and red denotes up-regulated genes (Blight vs. Healthy). The log2-fold change in the transcript levels was used for the analysis The hormone related genes Significant alteration in expression for genes involved in hormone related pathways was observed between the blight and healthy samples. Two genes, XLOC_027196 and XLOC_027197, which were annotated as homologs of Arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase 1 ( AAO1 ) and AAO3 , respectively, were up-regulated in blight trees. The AAO3 gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of ABA biosynthesis and plays a crucial role in ABA synthesis, whereas the AAO1 gene may contribute partially to ABA biosynthesis [ 25 ]. Two ABA3 genes (XLOC_011831 and XLOC_011832), which are the key regulator of ABA biosynthesis, were up-regulated. In addition, XLOC_028331 and XLOC_010730, which encode ABA responsive elements-binding factor 3 (ABF3) and ABF4 respectively, were also induced in blight trees (Additional file 1 : Table S1). Several genes involved in JA synthesis, such as allene oxidase synthase, allene oxidase cyclase and 12-Oxo-PDA-reductase genes, were down-regulated in blight trees (Fig. 3 ). Down-regulation of the ethylene synthesis genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) gene ACO1 (XLOC_012043) and ACO4 (XLOC_004937) was observed in blight trees. Furthermore, the ethylene responsive factors (ERFs), including ERF1, the crucial defense signaling factor for JA and ethylene signaling pathway, were down-regulated in blight trees (Additional file 1 : Table S1). Fig. 3 The JA synthesis pathway was repressed in blight trees. Blue denotes down-regulated genes, and red denotes up-regulated genes (Blight vs. Healthy). The figure was generated using MapMan software. The log2-fold change in the transcript levels was used for the analysis The plant defense system Two GO terms, (1- > 3)-beta-D-glucan biosynthetic process (GO:0006075) and callose deposition in phloem sieve plate (GO: 0080165), with 11 genes included, were enriched in the blight up-regulated gene set (Table 3 ), and all the 11 genes were annotated as glucan synthase-like (Gsl) genes (also known as callose synthase (Cals) genes). The mitogen-activated protein kinase gene MPK4 (XLOC_037129) and its upstream activator mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) gene MKK2 [ 26 ] (XLOC_012257) were down-regulated in blight trees. MPK4 is known as a negative regulator of SA-dependent systemic acquired resistance as well as a positive regulator of ET and JA mediated defense [ 27 , 28 ]. The down-regulation of MPK4 suggests that the JA and ET-related pathways were repressed, whereas the SA-related defense pathways were activated in blight trees. In fact, the JA and ET synthesis and signaling pathways were down-regulated (see above); in contrast, several SA-induced genes showed increased transcript abundance in blight trees. The NPR1 (nonexpresser of PR genes 1) (XLOC_012174, q-value = 0.038, log2FC = 0.93), which plays a key role in the SA-mediated defense signaling pathways, was up-regulated. NPR3 (XLOC_022440) and NPR4 (XLOC_022463 and XLOC_022469), which act as adaptor proteins for CUL3 E3 ligase to degrade NPR1 specifically [ 29 ], were down-regulated in blight trees. In addition, expression of the downstream pathogenesis-related (PR) gene PR1 (XLOC_026451) and MPK3 (XLOC_027731) was up-regulated in blight trees. Up-regulation of three SA-related WRKY transcription factors, WRKY33 (XLOC_019616), WRKY53 (XLOC_037606) and WRKY70 (XLOC_019719) and a gene encoding glutaredoxin (XLOC_004271) was also observed. RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq Twenty-five genes in the DEGs, including 11 down-regulated and 14 up-regulated genes, were selected for RT-qPCR assay to validate the RNA-seq results (Fig. 4 and Additional file 1 : Table S2). As shown in Fig. 4 , the RT-qPCR results suggested that the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with the RNA-seq data (R 2 = 0.966). Fig. 4 RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes. The log2FC values from the RNA-seq results are displayed on the x-axis, and the values from the RT-qPCR are displayed on the y-axis. The high R 2 (0.966) indicates the results from the RT-qPCR and RNA-seq are consistent Discussion Eight citrus cultivars have been sequenced, and two of them, sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ) and C. clementina, were assembled to draft genomes [ 18 , 19 ]. Swingle citrumelo was sequenced and assembled in this study. Swingle citrumelo is the most important rootstock in Florida, accounting for 37 % of all propagations as of 2012 [ 21 ]. Swingle citrumelo is a hybrid from Citrus paradisi Macf. X Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. [ 23 ]. The phylogenetic tree, which was constructed using the SNPhylo pipeline [ 30 ], demonstrated that Swingle citrumelo formed a separate clade from the clade containing the two published citrus genomes (see Additional file 1 : note 4 and Figure S1). Given the high variability of citrus cultivars, mainly due to hybridization during their complex evolutionary history [ 19 ], it was crucial to assemble the Swingle citrumelo genome to obtain a reliable annotation for RNA-seq analysis. The high consistence between RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results demonstrated the reliability of the assembly. The Swingle citrumelo draft genome will advance our understanding of plant biology and contribute to the citrus breeding. Transcriptome analysis of blight and healthy citrus plants provides insights to the molecular mechanism to the characteristic blight phenotypes. Firstly, the GO enrichment analysis and MapMan metabolism overview results demonstrated that many metabolism pathways were down-regulated in the roots of blight trees. The reduced metabolism in the roots is consistent with the overall decline of blight trees since roots are critical for plants to absorb water and nutrition (e.g., nitrogen and mineral elements). Secondly, the expression pattern of starch related genes is in agreement with the observation of a large number of starch grains in the parenchyma cells of the phloem [ 31 ]. Furthermore, the gene expression pattern of blight trees is consistent with the drought stress due to xylem blockage [ 6 ]. Starch synthesis genes were up-regulated in blight trees (Fig. 2 ), leading to starch deposition. Accumulation of starch has been suggested to help plants adapt to drought stress [ 32 ]. ABA also plays a key role in adaptive responses to drought stress [ 14 ]. Drought-mediated, up-regulation of ABA synthesis and ABA-induced downstream genes are widely reported [ 13 , 33 , 34 ]. Numerous genes involved in ABA synthesis and signaling showed increased transcript abundance in blight trees including ABA3, AAO1, AAO3, ABF3 and ABF4. AAO3 plays a key role in catalyzing the last step of the ABA synthesis pathway to help plants adapt to drought stress, which has been determined in leaves and seeds [ 25 , 35 ], and this gene is actively expressed in many tissues, including roots, stems and leaves [ 36 ]. Consistently, members of the ABF gene family function in ABA signaling and can be induced under abiotic stresses, including drought stress [ 13 , 37 – 39 ]. Plant hormones play key roles in regulating immune responses to a wide range of pathogens. Among them, SA, JA and ET (ethylene) are the most prominent. SA signaling triggers resistance against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens; in contrast, JA and ET work together to play an important role in defense against necrotrophs [ 40 , 41 ]. SA-mediated and JA- and/or ET-dependent defense pathways antagonize each other, and cooperation between them is not commonly observed [ 15 , 42 ]. Our RNA-seq results suggested the JA and ET biosynthesis pathways including ERF1 and ERF2 [ 43 , 44 ], were down-regulated in blight trees (Fig. 3 ). ERF proteins are responsible for regulating the expression of JA- and ET-mediated disease resistance response genes by binding to the GCC box (AGCCGCC) in their promoter regions [ 45 ]. Two known important positive regulators of JA- and ET- dependent, defense-related transcription, were identified in the down-regulated genes, suggesting the JA and ET-mediated immune systems were repressed in blight trees. On the other hand, up-regulation of NPR1, the central regulator of SA-dependent gene activation and SAR [ 46 ], and down-regulation of NPR3 and NPR4, which work as adapters for NPR1 degradation [ 29 ], as well as the up-regulation of downstream defense genes (e.g., PR1 and MPK3), indicated that the SA-mediated defense system was activated. The down-regulation of MPK4, which acts as a negative regulator of SA signaling and a positive regulator of JA signaling [ 28 ], as well as the up-regulation of glutaredoxin gene, which can be induced by SA and suppresses JA-responsive PDF1.2 transcription [ 47 ], further supported our notion. Furthermore, callose ((1,3)-β-glucan polymer) synthesis and deposition can play an important role in the defense response to invading pathogens [ 48 , 49 ]. We observed the induction of 11 CalS genes in blight diseased trees (Table 3 ). In Arabidopsis , the expression of CalS1 (Gsl-6) and CalS2 (Gsl-3) is NPR1-dependent [ 50 ]. The induction of SA-dependent defense genes and the repression of JA- and ET-mediated immune systems supported the proposition that a systemic infectious agent, probably an unidentified biotrophic pathogen, is involved in citrus blight, as suggested by Derrick and Timmer [ 5 ]. However, given the fact that the plant hormone signaling pathways are well programmed by plant to respond to both biotic and abiotic stresses, the possibility of certain abiotic stress contributed to the observed antagonism between JA-ET dependent and SA mediated signaling pathways could not be ruled out [ 51 ]. Conclusions In conclusion, we have sequenced and assembled the draft genome of Swingle citrumelo. We also analyzed the root transcriptome of blight and healthy trees. The transcriptome analysis provides insights to the molecular mechanism underneath the characteristic blight phenotypes including decline, starch accumulation, and drought stress. The activation of SA-dependent defense pathways and the repression of JA- and ET- mediated defense pathways were observed in blight trees, further supporting that unidentified biotrophic pathogen(s) was/were involved in citrus blight. This study deepened our understanding of the pathophysiology of citrus blight. However, the causal agent remains undetermined and yet to be determined. Methods Plant materials, nucleic acid extraction and sequencing Sweet orange on Swingle citrumelo [ Citrus paradise Macf. × Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] (synonym: Citrus × paradisi × Citrus trifoliate , NCBI taxonomy ID: 309804) rootstock in a citrus grove located at St. Cloud (28°15’ N, 81°14’ W) was selected to collect root samples from healthy and blight trees. These trees were approximately 20 years old. The trees were diagnosed as blight-diseased based on visual symptoms, the p12 immunoassay on leaf tissues (Additional file 1 : Figure S2), and water uptake results [ 6 , 7 ]. The trees were followed for two years for disease development after sampling. Based on initial and later diagnoses, the trees were classified as healthy (2 trees, 20_6 and 24_8, water uptake >20 ml/30 s in all tests during the two years period), pre-blight (2 trees, 18_7 and 23_11, healthy when collected samples but diagnosed as blight one year after the initial diagnosis, water uptake >20 ml/30 s for the initial survey but <5 ml/30 s for the second survey), blight (2 trees, 14_14 and 16_11, water uptake =0 ml/30 s for two years tests) and late-blight (1 tree, 20_2, the symptoms were very severe at one year after the initial diagnosis) (Additional file 1 : Figure S2). Around 10 cm lateral root segments (diameter approximately 0.5 cm) were collected from four corners of one tree and were pooled together. Two root segments from two individual lateral roots were harvested from each corner and eight segments were collected for each tree. The rhizosphere soil was removed, and roots were cleaned by repeated washing (3 rinses) using pre-cooled ddH 2 O. Then, the roots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All the steps were performed on site. When back to laboratory, the frozen materials were stored at −80 °C until use. The woody part was removed with pre-cooled knife, and the remaining part of the roots was grounded to a homogenous powder using a sterilized mortar and pestle and liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit, and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by performing the following On-column DNase digestion step, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). The integrity of the RNA was verified on an Agilent RNA6000 Pico Chip. Plant ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic kit (PNMRZSR116) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Epicenter Technologies). The RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Script Seq v2 RNA-Seq library preparation kit (Epicenter Technologies). Total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy plant maxi kit (Qiagen). DNA libraries were prepared through a semi-automated procedure using a Beckman Coulter SPRI-TE™ workstation. The RNA and DNA samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform for 101 cycles in both directions. Swingle citrumelo draft genome assembly and annotation The 81,496,678 × 2 paired-end raw DNA reads from tree 23_11 were trimmed using CLC genomic workbench (V6.0.1, CLC Bio) with the following the parameters: minimum quality score 0.05, maximum number of ambiguities 2 and discarding the reads containing adapters or reads shorter than 55 bp. A total of 69,656,379 × 2 high quality paired-end reads with average length 97.6 bp were kept and were assembled using CLC genomic workbench (V6.0.1, CLC Bio) with an iterative adaptive assembly approach with a range of word sizes. The contigs generated by the assembly of word size 33 were chosen for further analysis because a word size of 33 produced the longest (on average) contigs and the highest matched reads. The citrus-originated contigs were extracted, scaffolded and gap-filled using a reference-based approach [ 18 ]. The completeness and accuracy of the coding region of the draft assembly were validated using the Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) [ 52 ] as well as EST mapping using sim4db and exonerate [ 53 , 54 ], respectively. The annotation of this draft genome was created using MAKER2 pipeline [ 55 ]. The detailed genome assembly and annotation pipeline are listed in the Additional file 1 : notes 1–3. Differential expression analysis The differential gene expression between healthy and blight citrus samples was analyzed following the tuxedo pipeline [ 22 ]. In brief, the RNA-seq reads were trimmed as described above. The trimmed reads were mapped to the Swingle citrumelo draft assembly using Tophat2 (ver. 2.0.7), and the generated alignments were fed to Cufflinks (ver. 2.1.1) for transcript assembly. The assemblies from individual samples were merged with the annotation set generated by MAKER2 using Cuffmerge. Gene differential expression analysis was performed using Cuffdiff2 [ 56 ], the two healthy trees (20_6 and 24_8) and two blight trees (14_14 and 16_11) were used in the analysis and group-wise comparison was conducted. The results were explored using CummeRbund ( http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/ ). Only genes fitting the following cutoff: |fold change| ≥ 2, q-value ≤ 0.05 and FPKM ≥1, were considered as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The GO terms and plant GO SLIM terms were assigned to the annotated genes of the Swingle citrumelo assembly, and the gene set enrichment analysis of the DEGs was conducted using Blast2GO pipeline [ 57 ]. The GO terms and the plant GO SLIM terms were assigned to transcripts based on the b2gsep13 GO database. The up-regulated and down-regulated DEG transcript lists were used as input for the one-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test in Blast2GO to identify the enriched GO terms. In addition, the MapMan gene functional categories (Bins) were assigned to DEGs using Mercator [ 58 ], and differentially regulated bins were identified using MapMan [ 59 ]. RT-qPCR analysis Total RNA from the same samples used for RNA-seq was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) 20 primer using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). The gene expression patterns of FBOX, SAND, GAPC2 (GAPDH) and UPL7, which are recommended as superior reference genes by Mafra et al. [ 60 ], were checked from the Cuffdiff result, and GAPC2 was chosen as the reference gene because of its high and constant expression level in our samples. The primers for the target genes (Additional file 1 : Table S3) were designed using the Primer3 (Ver. 0.4.0) online tool ( http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/ ). For each primer set, cDNA corresponding to 10 ng of total RNA was subjected to qPCR using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The qPCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). The PCR thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial step at 95 °C for 15 min and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. The signal was collected at the 72 °C step. The ΔΔC t method [ 61 ] was used to analyze the results.

2025-10-28 16:16:27,650 - INFO - Using prompt: Extract all genotype and NCBI accession information from the scientific article below. You MUST follow these steps:

        STEP 1 - SYSTEMATIC READING:
        Read the ENTIRE article text carefully, section by section:
        - Abstract: Check for study overview and organism mentions
        - Introduction: Look for study context and varieties being investigated
        - Materials and Methods: PRIMARY source for genotypes and sample descriptions
        - Results: Check for any additional genotype details or data references
        - Discussion: May contain references to data deposition
        - Data Availability Statement: CRITICAL section for NCBI accessions
        - Supplementary Information references: Note what information is external
        - Acknowledgments: Sometimes contains data repository information
        - TABLES: Pay special attention to tables (often formatted with pipes |, dashes -, or aligned columns). Tables frequently contain:
            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context
        - LOW: Ambiguous mentions, incomplete information, or indirect references

        STEP 5 - SOURCE TRACKING:
        - "main text": Information in the primary article body
        - "supplementary file": Referenced in supplementary materials (but actual content not in provided text)
        - "data availability statement": In data/code availability sections
        - "methods appendix": In detailed methods/materials sections
        - "not found": Information explicitly missing from the document

        STEP 6 - REASONING OUTPUT (MANDATORY):
        Before generating the final JSON, you MUST output your reasoning process in plain text using this format:

Introduction: Citrus is an important fruit crop for human health. The sensitivity of citrus trees to a wide range of abiotic stresses is a major challenge for their overall growth and productivity. Among these abiotic stresses, salinity results in a signi /uniFB01 cant loss of global citrus yield. In order to /uniFB01 nd straightforward and sustainable solutions for the future and to ensure citrus productivity, it is of paramount importance to decipher the mechanisms responsible for salinity stress tolerance. Thisstudy aimed to investigate how ploidy levels in /uniFB02 uence salt stress tolerance in citrus by comparing the transcriptomic responses of diploid and tetraploid genotypes. In a previous article we investigated the physiological and biochemical response of four genotypes with different ploidy levels: diploid trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata [L.] Raf.) (PO2x) and Cleopatra mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort. Ex Tan.) (CL2x) and their respective tetraploids (PO4x, CL4x).

Methods: In this study, we useda multifactorial gene selection and gene clustering approach to /uniFB01 nely dissect the in /uniFB02 uence of ploidy level on the salt stress response of each genotype. Following transcriptome sequencing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identi /uniFB01 ed in response to salt stress in leaves and roots of the different citrus genotypes.

Result and discussion: Gene expression pro /uniFB01 les and functional characterization of genes involved in the response to salt stress, as a function of ploidy level and the interaction between stress response and ploidy level, have enabled us to highlight the mechanisms involved in the varieties tested. Saltstress induced overexpression of carbohydrate biosynthesis and cell wall remodelling- related genes speci /uniFB01 cally in CL4x Ploidy level enhanced oxidative stress response in PO

## 1 Introduction

Citrus fruits are among the most important fruit crops worldwide. In the Mediterranean Basin and several other countries, they are mainly cultivated in coastal areas (Spreen et al., 2020), where they are increasingly affected by abiotic stress such as drought, extreme temperature and salinity (ColmeneroFlores et al., 2020). Salinity can reduce growth in citrus trees and cause physiological disorders (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005; Aouad et al., 2015; Ben Yahmed et al., 2015). Citrus crops are highly salt sensitive, and their response to soil salinity depends on the rootstock and scion, the soil type, the irrigation system that is used and the climate (Sykes, 2011; Ziogas et al., 2021). Salinity damages happen when the dissolved salt in water reduces the amount of water available in the root zone for hydration (Benyahia and Aditi, 2022). Movement of water in the leaf tissues of citrus can cause accumulation of chloride (Cl -) ions that in turn affect the transpiration and photosynthesis (Allario et al., 2011; Ashraf and Harris, 2013). Increasing Cl -concentration accelerates defoliation by enhancing leaf abscission and ethylene production (Brumo ́ s et al., 2009; Hussain et al., 2012). Our previous work demonstrated that tetraploidy enhances photosynthetic and antioxidant capacities under salt stress. Building on this, the present study aims to investigate the underlying transcriptomic mechanisms (Bonnin et al., 2023). Breeding programs were designed for decades to produce new salt-tolerant rootstocks. Indeed, to cope with biotic and abiotic constraints, citrus trees are grafted onto rootstocks selected for their adaptability (Nawaz et al., 2016; Caruso et al., 2020).

and ion management capacity in both genotypes. Results further highlighted that under stress conditions, only the CL4x genotype up- regulated genes involved in sugar biosynthesis, transport management, cell wall remodelling, hormone signalling, enzyme regulation and antioxidant metabolism. These /uniFB01 ndings provide crucial insights that could inform breeding strategies for developing salt-tolerant citrus varieties.

## KEYWORDS

citrus, differentially expressed genes, salt stress, tetraploid, transcriptomic study new rootstocks that are better adapted to salt stress. Sour orange (C. aurantium L.) was identi /uniFB01 ed as an excellent Na + excluder with good Cl -exclusion capacity (Zekri, 1991). It was the main citrus rootstock worldwide during the /uniFB01 rst half of the 20 th century. Unfortunately, because of the susceptibility of this genotype to citrus Tristeza virus (CTV), it was necessary to move to other rootstocks with CTV resistance. Trifoliate orange ( P. trifoliata [L.] Raf.) (PO) and its hybrids (citranges and Swingle citrumelo) are CTV tolerant rootstocks (Barry et al., 2020; Bowman and Joubert, 2020). However, they are unfortunately classi /uniFB01 ed as sensitive to salinity (Khoshbakht et al., 2014). When grafted, PO is characterized by a super /uniFB01 cial root system, making it sensitive to drought (Khoshbakht et al., 2014). It has also been described as sensitive to alkalinity (Khoshbakht et al., 2014). Poncirus hybrids such as Carrizo citrange ( Poncirus trifoliata x Citrus sinensis ) and Swingle 4475 citrumelo ( Poncirus trifoliata x Citrus paradisi ) are also commonly used as rootstocks. They share with their Poncirus parent tolerance to CTV and sensitivity to chlorides and drought. Many studies suggested that stress tolerance might be heritable traits (Storey and Walker, 1998; Singh et al., 2003; Flowers, 2004; Hussain et al., 2012; McGowan et al., 2021). Among Citrus species, Cleopatra mandarin ( C. reshni Hort. Ex Tan.) (CL) has been identi /uniFB01 ed as an excellent parental genotype in breeding programs because it has excellent salt stress tolerance properties (Zekri, 1991; Moya et al., 2003; Hussain et al., 2012; Raga et al., 2016). Used as rootstock, it is also tolerant to cold, drought, chlorides and limestone.

Rootstocks are distinguished from scion varieties of agronomic interest by their intended use (Barry et al., 2020). Scion varieties are selected for the organoleptic qualities of their fruit, fruit size and yield. Rootstocks are chosen above all for their resistance to disease, pests, climate and soil type. Grafting a variety of agronomic interest onto a speci /uniFB01 c rootstock improves the graft ' s chances of survival (Caruso et al., 2020). The increase in salinity associated with climate change calls for

Abbreviations: PO, Poncirus trifoliata [L.] Raf.); CL, Cleopatra mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort. Ex Tan.); diploid, 2x; tetraploid, 4x.

Increasing evidence suggests that polyploid citrus could have better environmental stress tolerance (Grosser et al., 2015; Oustric et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2020; Sivager et al., 2021; Lourkisti et al., 2022; Bonnin et al., 2023). An individual with more than 2n copies of chromosomes is polyploid. With a few exceptions, such as the triploid Persian lime (Ahmed et al., 2020), citrus are generally diploid (2x), having nine homologous chromosomes (n = 9) (Krug, 1943).

Previous work we performed (Bonnin et al., 2023) showed the interaction between genotypes and the ploidy level, allowing behaviour discrimination in terms of photosynthetic and antioxidant capacities under salt stress. Ploidy level enhanced PO ' s and CL ' s capacity to maintain photosynthetic activity under salt stress and enhanced their antioxidant capacities. Therefore, we

concluded that tetraploidy may enhance salt stress tolerance in citrus. The objective of this study is to elucidate the transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the enhanced salt stress tolerance observed in tetraploid citrus genotypes compared to their diploid counterparts (Bonnin et al., 2023).

Polyploidization occurs during mitosis or gamete-formation mechanisms ' malfunction. Studies on citrus at the genomic, transcriptomic (Snoussi et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2020) and epigenetic levels have focused on the general pattern of neoregulation of the transcriptome (mRNA) (Xie, 2018; Song et al., 2023). So far, genes identi /uniFB01 ed as important in salt tolerance are diverse and fall into the categories of osmoprotectant production, transcription factors involved in the regulation of growth and ion transporters and compatible solutes (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005; Ahmad et al., 2013; AbdElgawad et al., 2016; Acosta-Motos et al., 2017). This study aims to address the gap in knowledge of current genes involved in citrus salt stress tolerance, revealing genes involved in cell wall modi /uniFB01 cation and antioxidant responses.

## 2 Materials and methods

## 2.1 Plant material and salt stress experiment

A transcriptomic experiment was performed on the same plant material and experimental design described in Bonnin et al. (2023). Brie /uniFB02 y, four free-standing citrus genotypes were selected (Supplementary Table S1). Diploid (2x) trifoliate orange ( P. trifoliata ) (Poncirus Pomeroy ICVN-0110081) (PO2x) and 2x Cleopatra mandarin ( C. reshni ) (ICVN-0110274) (CL2x) and their two doubled diploid counterparts, 4x trifoliate orange ( P. trifoliata ) (ICVN-01011106) (PO4x) and 4x Cleopatra mandarin (ICVN-0101110) (CL4x) were evaluated in leaves and roots under salt stress conditions. Even if our study aim to select rootstock better adapted to salt stress, leaves data can provide a more comprehensive overview of the genetic regulation mechanism of salt stress. Brie /uniFB02 y, plants selected for experimentation were divided into two blocks and watered once a week. Stressed plants were watered with a nutrient solution supplemented with salt (NaCl), and control plants were irrigated with nutrient solution only. Salt concentrations were steadily increased from 30 mM to 90 mM at increments of 20 mM per week and then stabilized at 90 mM.

## 2.2 Sample preparation and sequencing

Leaves and roots of the four citrus seedlings genotypes under the control and stressed conditions (90mM NaCl) were ground to a /uniFB01 ne powder in liquid nitrogen under the RNAse-free condition. RNA extraction was performed using the NucleoMag ® kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co.KU, Düren, Germany) with the KingFisher automated system (KingFisher Flex Puri /uniFB01 cation System, ThermoFisher Scienti /uniFB01 c, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol. RNA integrity and quality were checked on TapeStation, screentape D5000. RNAseq libraries were prepared to obtain labelled and matched sequences using UDI indexes, following the protocol and recommendations from the Illumina Truseq kit. The integrity and quality of the libraries were checked on TapeStation, screentape D5000 and assayed by qPCR. A /uniFB01 rst sequencing of the libraries was then performed to validate their quality using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing system at the Agap genotyping platform (Cirad, Montpellier). The equimolar pool of the libraries was then built up using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit from Illumina. Sequencing was performed on a 150-nt pair-end S4 /uniFB02 ow cell lane by MGX in Montpellier. The clustering and sequencing steps were performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using the SBS (Sequence By Synthesis) technique with NovaSeq Reagent Kits using the Illumina TruSeq RNA protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

## 2.3 Data quality control and analysis

A total of 2.135.095.822 pairs of paired end reads of 150 nucleotides were generated from an Illumina Novaseq 6000 for the 48 samples with a mean of 44.481.163 read-pairs per samples. The rate of trimmed base was 8.79% and after low length reads removal, 2.122.477.755 (99.4%) of the initial read pairs remain available for mapping. 95.4% of these reads were successfully mapped on the reference genomes using STAR, with a multimapping rate of 3.48%. 86.3% of the mapped reads were asigned to knows features and were used for counting. More details can be found in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figures S5, S6.

The quality of raw data from high-throughput sequencing was assessed by calculating different metrics, such as the quality of the sequences per base using the FastQC software (v.0.11.9). Our experimental design is described as follows: for each tissue (roots or shoots)/2 independent genotypes/2 ploidy levels/2 modalities (control/stress)/3 biological replicates (Supplementary Table S1). RNASeq sequences of 2x and 4x Poncirus trifoliata (PO2x and PO4x) were aligned on the PO as reference genome (Peng et al., 2020), while 2x and 4x Cleopatra mandarin (CL2x and CL4x) were aligned with CL genome (Droc et al., in press 1 ). Cutadapt [v3.5; (Martin, 2011)] was used to /uniFB01 nd and remove Illumina Trueseq adapter sequences, remove low-quality base pairs in 5 ' and 3 ' of each read based on a quality cut-off of 30 and discard resulting pairs of reads containing a read shorter than 50 bases. Poly-g tails were also removed using the nextseq-trim option with a cut-off of 20. STAR (2.7.3a) (Dobin et al., 2013) was used with default parameters to align the reads on the reference genomes. To obtain count matrices, featureCount function of the Subread tool was used (release 2.0.1, 10 May 2023), with the options -M and -fraction

to consider multi-mapped reads (Liao et al., 2013; Stark et al., 2019; Amarasinghe et al., 2020).

## 2.4 Statistical analysis for gene selection

Gene counts from each genotype and tissue were analysed using DESeq2 R package (Love et al., 2014). Genes with expression-level changes depending on the treatment, the ploidy level, or the interactions between the two factors, were selected using the likelihood ratio test (LRT), following the multifactorial design protocol in the DESeq2 R package as described in Favreau et al. (2023). Brie /uniFB02 y, the LRT was applied to simultaneously test all the treatments and levels according to the multifactorial model Stress + Ploidy + Stress x Ploidy. Signi /uniFB01 cant genes were selected at false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p -values &lt; 0.01 threshold. To evaluate the quality of the LRT selected genes and to explore the underlying structure of the selected gene set, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was run using the Mixomics R package (release 3.17) (Le ̂ Cao et al., 2011; Rohart et al., 2017). For each gene set, from the two genotypes and two tissues, three lists of genes were extracted: those responding only to each speci /uniFB01 c effect, ploidy and stress, and those responding to the interaction ploidy x stress.

Co-expression analysis was performed on the signi /uniFB01 cant genes, selected according to the multifactorial model. The coseq R package (Rau and Maugis-Rabusseau, 2018) was used through the DIANE (Cassan et al., 2021) package with a normal model, an arcsin data transformation, a number of clusters between 3 and 20 and a seed /uniFB01 xed to 100.

The non-parametric Kruskall Wallis test was used to determine whether, for a given set of groups, there was at least one that was different from the others When KW test was able to identify d differences between groups, it was required to know which variables was concerned. We therefore carried out a pairwise multiple comparison, by using Dunn ' s test (Dunn, 1973). KW and Dunn use the same ranks assigned to individuals to carry out their treatments.

## 2.5 Functional categorisation

Functional analysis of the genes was performed. Gene ontology (GO) associated with each gene was found using a combination of Interproscan (Jones et al., 2014) and blast best hit (Ward and Moreno-Hagelsieb, 2014) against the Viridiplantae subset of Uniprot SwissProt and TremBL. GO enrichment was then performed using the Cytoscape plugin BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005). For each list of genes, signi /uniFB01 cantly enriched GO terms were identi /uniFB01 ed using a hypergeometric test and a multiple test correction using the Benjamini and Hochberg FDR correction with a signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Thissen et al., 2002; Reiner et al., 2003; Ferreira, 2007; Green and Diggle, 2007; Stephanie, 2015). Enriched GO terms having similar functions were clustered using the Enrichment Map and AutoAnnotate plugins of the Cytoscape software (Isserlin et al., 2014; Kucera et al., 2016). Default parameters were applied for each plugin.

## 3 Results

In this section, we pinpoint signi /uniFB01 cant groups of genes with contrasting expression pro /uniFB01 les under salt stress according to the ploidy level of each genotype, regulating speci /uniFB01 c biological functions. More speci /uniFB01 cally, our /uniFB01 ndings highlighted six categories of genes that are enriched in photosynthesis, sugar metabolism, cell wall remodelling, ROS detoxi /uniFB01 cation, gene expression regulation and signalling.

## 3.1 Data structure analysis

## 3.1.1 Discriminant analysis

Quality and structuration of CL and PO datasets were assessed thanks to independent PLS-DA analysis (Figure 1). For both CL tissues, salt treatment was the /uniFB01 rst factor that discriminated the gene expression pro /uniFB01 les between the samples. The /uniFB01 rst principal component (PC1) explained 30% and 34% of the variability in leaves (Figure 1A) and roots (Figure 1B), respectively. Ploidy level was discriminated by PC2, representing 20% and 15% of the variability in leaves (Figure 1A) and roots (Figure 1B), respectively. In CL leaves, PC3 (14% of the variability) discriminated CL2x control (CL2xC) from other genotypes (Supplementary Figure S1A). In roots, PC3 (12% of the variability) discriminated the stressed CL2x (CL2xS) from the other genotypes (Supplementary Figure S1B). For PO, salt stress was the /uniFB01 rst factor that discriminated the leaf samples (PC1 = 37%; Figure 1C), and PC2 discriminated the two ploidy levels (33% of the variability). In PO leaves, however, PC3 (8% of the variability) discriminated the stressed PO2x (PO2xS) (Supplementary Figure S1C) from the other genotypes. In PO roots (Figure 1D), control and stressed treatments were discriminated on PC1 (28% of the variability), and ploidy levels were discriminated on PC2 (23% of the variability) for the control only. Moreover, in PO roots, PC3 (10% of the variability) discriminated between control PO2x (PO2xC) and the stressed PO4x (PO4xS) on one side and the other genotypes (PO4xC and PO2xS) on the other side.

In both tissues, for both PO and CL genotypes, salt stress is the primary factor discriminating gene expression pro /uniFB01 les between samples. Ploidy level is discriminated on PC2, except in PO roots where ploidy level is discriminated only for controls. These results demonstrate that the interaction between ploidy level and salt treatment in /uniFB02 uences data variability. Based on this result, three independent gene lists were created. The absence of a common gene between the gene lists suggests that in 4x, different signalling pathways and biological targets could be regulated by stress, ploidy and/or the effect of the interaction between stress and ploidy.

Gene expression was investigated for each genotype and each tissue. More speci /uniFB01 cally, the factors in /uniFB02 uencing the variation of the gene expression were identi /uniFB01 ed ( i.e ., the ploidy level, the stress application or the interaction between both). Among the regulated

genes in CL leaves (Supplementary Figure S2A), 4% of the genes were regulated according to the ploidy level only, 79% according to the treatment applied and 18% according to the interaction between ploidy and stress application (Table 1). In CL roots (Supplementary Figure S2B), 9%, 82% and 9% the genes were regulated according to the ploidy, the salt stress and the interaction between ploidy and stress, respectively (Table 1). In PO leaves (Supplementary Figure S2C), 26%, 34% and 40% the genes varied according to the ploidy, stress and the interaction between both, respectively (Table 1). In PO roots (Supplementary Figure S2D), only 15 genes were regulated according to ploidy level (1% of the total), while 81% and 19% varied according to the stress and the interaction between ploidy and stress, respectively (Table 1).

## 3.2 Identi /uniFB01 cation of the biological processes regulated according to both stress and ploidy level

PLS-DA analysis highlighted that, for each genotype and tissue, stress treatment differentially modi /uniFB01 ed gene expression depending on the ploidy level. Therefore, to identify the biological processes that differentiate the response of each ploidy level to salt stress, GO enrichment was performed on the gene list regulated by ' ploidy x treatment ' (Table 2; Figures 2, 3; Supplementary Table S2). To deepen the previous analysis, we searched for groups of genes, and corresponding biological processes, that could characterise each ploidy level ' s speci /uniFB01 c response to salt stress. Therefore, gene coexpression was analysed in the list ' ploidy × treatment ' for each genotype and tissue, and clusters of genes having similar expression pro /uniFB01 les were identi /uniFB01 ed (Figure 4).

In CL leaves, peroxisome and microbody processes were differentially regulated between 2x and 4x under salt stress (Figure 2A; Supplementary Table S2), and in CL roots, signalling and transport functions differed between the two ploidy levels (Figure 2B; Supplementary Table S2). In (CL), 20 clusters in leaves (Figure 4A) and 18 in roots (Figure 4B) were identi /uniFB01 ed. In the PO genotype, 20 and 14 clusters were identi /uniFB01 ed in leaves and roots, respectively (Figures 4C, D). For each tissue and genotype, clusters were classi /uniFB01 ed by trends: genes up- or down-regulated for 2x and 4x between control and stressed plants. In CL leaves, four groups of clusters are identi /uniFB01 ed (Figure 4A). Genes belonging to group 1 (clusters n°6 and 12) are downregulated in both 2x and 4x under salt stress compared to the control treatment, but at a different amplitude for each ploidy. These genes are mostly involved in photosynthesis (Supplementary Table S2). Gene expression from group 2 (clusters n°5, 11 and 20) increases in stressed 4x, compared to the control, and shows no variation of expression or is down-regulated in stressed 2x, compared to the control. Corresponding genes are associated with trehalose biosynthesis, K + transport and cell wall remodelling. Genes from group 3 (clusters n°16 and 19) are up-regulated in both 2x and 4x under stress compared to the control at a different amplitude according to the ploidy level. They are related with ion transport and peroxisome processes (Supplementary Table S2). Genes from group 4 (clusters n°8, 10 and 15) are up-regulated in 2x but do not vary or are down-regulated in 4x under salt stress, compared to the control. They are mostly associated with chitin and antioxidant metabolism, cell wall remodelling and microbody processes (Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, in CL roots, on 18 clusters selected previously, only ten presented GO enrichment (Supplementary Table S2). GO-enriched clusters could be classi /uniFB01 ed into two groups of expression pro /uniFB01 les: genes from group 1 (clusters n°2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13 and 15) having no variation of expression or presenting down-regulation for 2x, while they are up-regulated in the 4x for stressed plants compared to the control (Figure 4B). They are mostly associated with sterol and steroid biosynthesis, transmembrane transport (K + transport, passive and active transport) and signalling (Supplementary Table S2). Clusters belonging to group 2 (clusters n° 1, 11 and 17) contain genes that are up-regulated in stressed 2x and down-regulated in stressed 4x compared to the control (Figure 4B). They are related to cellulose and polysaccharide biosynthesis, chitin metabolism, posttranscriptional regulation (RNA-processing) and signalling (Supplementary Table S2).

Node size is proportional to the number of expressed genes. Intensity of node orange coloration corresponds to adjusted p-value (p-adjust). Edges length between nodes is proportional to the degree of functional similarity between them. Nodes having very similar biological functions were clustered and labelled with a summarized name.

In both CL and PO, there are groups of under-expressed genes, whatever the ploidy level considered under salt stress conditions. The genes in these groups share GO terms related to the photosynthesis process. This result is in line with the /uniFB01 ndings of the previous chapter, showing a disruption of photosynthesis processes in all the genotypes tested.

In PO leaves, among the number of enriched GO terms, we identi /uniFB01 ed GO terms linked to sugar biosynthesis, photosynthesis and cell wall remodelling (Figure 3A; Supplementary Table S2). Cell wall organisation and biogenesis were regulated in PO roots (Figure 3B; Supplementary Table S2). Altogether, these results reveal that under salt stress, cell wall remodelling, sugar biosynthesis, photosynthesis, signalling and regulation of gene expression were differentially regulated between the two ploidy levels. In PO leaves, nine clusters had enriched GO (Supplementary Table S2) that could be classi /uniFB01 ed into /uniFB01 ve groups of expression patterns. Group 1 (clusters n°5, 7 and 19) presents genes down-regulated in stressed plants, compared to the control, with different amplitudes in 2x and 4x. They are enriched in GO terms associated with ROS metabolism, cell wall remodelling, photosynthesis and ion transport (Supplementary Table S2). Group 2

(clusters n°9) contains genes up-regulated in 2x and in 4x stressed genotypes at different amplitudes compared to the control (Figure 4C). They are mostly associated with post-transcriptional regulation (RNAsplicing). Group 3 (clusters n°8 and 13) is characterised by a downregulation in CL4xS compared to its control, while gene expression does not vary in 2x (Figure 4C). They are mostly associated with cell wall remodelling, enzyme activity regulation (Supplementary Table S2; Figure 4C), post-transcriptional regulation (RNA-processing) and epigenetic regulation (histone modi /uniFB01 cation) (Supplementary Table S2). Finally, cluster analysis on PO roots highlighted eight GOenriched clusters (Supplementary Table S2) that could be classi /uniFB01 ed into four groups of expression patterns.

Group 1 (clusters n°8, 10 and n°11) is composed of downregulated genes in PO4xS compared to PO4xC; these genes are upregulated in PO2xS compared to PO2xC (Figure 4D). They are principally related to photosynthesis (Supplementary Table S2). We found another group of genes in PO leaves that were underexpressed at all ploidy levels. This time, these genes were linked to carbohydrate metabolism. In CL, genes whose functions are linked to carbohydrate metabolism do not have the same

expression pro /uniFB01 le. Their expression does not vary in 2x, but increases in 4x under salt stress. Higher sugar levels in CL4x could therefore contribute to its better adaptation to salt stress.

In group 2 (cluster n°2), genes are up-regulated in 2xS compared to 2xC, with no variation observed in 4x (Figure 4D). They are mostly related to translation regulation (Supplementary Table S2). Genes belonging to group 3 (cluster n°7) are down-regulated in 2xS compared to the control, while they do not vary in 4x (Figure 4D). They are principally related to GO terms linked to cell wall remodelling and transcription factor activity (Supplementary Table S2). Group 4 (clusters n°3, 9, 12 and 13) genes are down-regulated in 2xS compared to 2xC. Conversely, genes of these clusters are up-regulated in the corresponding 4xS compared to 4xC (Figure 4D). They are mostly related to hormone signalling (abscisic acid), antioxidant activity, ion transport and enzyme activity regulation (Supplementary Table S2). Among the clusters possessing genes overexpressed in 4x under salt stress, in contrast to their 2x counterparts, we also found genes linked to cell wall remodelling and transport activities and maintenance of ionic homeostasis. Overall, our results show that in both CL and PO, the level of ploidy in /uniFB02 uences transport management under salt stress. Enhanced ion storage or exclusion could improve salt stress tolerance in 4x genotypes.

## 3.3 Identi /uniFB01 cation of genes regulated according to ploidy level or stress

Beside genes in /uniFB02 uenced by ploidy and stress, it was interesting to identify the molecular mechanisms that were in /uniFB02 uenced by each factor regardless of the other. First, GO enrichment was performed on both lists of genes, ' ploidy ' and ' stress ' , and a map enrichment of GOterms designed. GO terms were summarised in clusters including GO belonging to similar pathways and processes, representing main biological mechanisms (Table 2). In CL leaves, GO terms identi /uniFB01 ed in genes regulated under stress treatment are principally related to glycolytic process, primary metabolism, photosynthesis, amino-acid

binding and protein dephosphorylation (Table 2; Supplementary Figure S3A). In CL roots, genes are mostly associated with nucleotide biosynthesis, protein localisation, protein biosynthesis and regulation of primary metabolism (Table 2; Supplementary Figure S3B; Supplementary Table S2). In PO leaves, an important number of genes linked to regulation of transcription and translation (Table 2, Figure 5A) were identi /uniFB01 ed. In PO roots, genes involved in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex concerned with gene expression (Table 2; Figure 5B) as well as nucleotide binding and regulation of circadian rhythm were also found. Altogether, our results suggest that, in both PO and CL, salt stress treatment induced neoregulation for a large number of genes involved in reprograming, targeting photosynthesis, signalling and cellular biosynthetic process.

To study the in /uniFB02 uence of the ploidy level on gene expression, irrespective of the treatment applied, GO enrichment analysis was performed with the list ' ploidy ' for each genotype (Supplementary Table S2). In CL leaves (Table 2; Figure 6A), the only enriched biological process that explained the difference between ploidy levels was the ADP binding process (Table 2; Figure 6A). In CL roots, the expression of a higher number of genes was in /uniFB02 uenced by ploidy level (Table 2; Figure 6B; Supplementary Table S2). DEGs related to ploidy were mostly involved in signalling, transcriptional

<!-- image -->

regulation of primary metabolism, regulation of ROS response, organic acid transport and transmembrane transport activity (Table 2; Figure 6B). This suggests a possible role of ploidy level in signalling, gene expression reprograming and antioxidant defence systems in CL roots.

Strikingly, in PO leaves, genes regulated according to ploidy level (Supplementary Figure S4A) are mostly related to posttranslational regulation. Finally, in PO roots (Supplementary Figure S4B), three clusters of gene sets were identi /uniFB01 ed. The most important ones are related to regulation of photosystem II by chlorophyll binding, nucleoside metabolism and structural constituents of cell walls.

## 3.4 Identi /uniFB01 cation of genes regulated according to ploidy level under control conditions

In CL roots, genes regulated according to ploidy level under control conditions (Supplementary Table S2) are mostly related to post-translational regulation and response to oxidative stress. No GO enrichment was detected in CL leaves under control conditions when focusing on genes strictly in /uniFB02 uenced by ploidy level. In PO roots under control conditions, genes strictly in /uniFB02 uenced by ploidy level are related to ADP binding. Similarly, in PO roots, we identi /uniFB01 ed genes mostly related to sugar and nucleotide metabolism (Supplementary Table S2).

## 4 Discussion

In several studies, chromosome set doubling was shown to provide better adaptation to different abiotic stresses, including salt stress (Ruiz et al., 2020; Bonnin et al., 2023). Relevant crops include citrus (Ruiz et al., 2020), watermelon (Zhu et al., 2018), and soybean (Mangena, 2023). These studies showed that a whole-genome duplication has a strong, genome-wide effect on gene expression and that the transcriptional response to stress varies between 4x and 2x. Our previous work demonstrated that in PO and CL, 4x displayed enhanced salt tolerance compared with 2x (Bonnin

et al., 2023). Here, we emphasised the gene expression determinant of salt stress tolerance in these two genotypes, comparing 4x vs 2x plants. We characterized the response to salt stress of our genotypes into six gene-function classes: (1) photosynthesis, (2) osmoprotection, (3) cell wall remodelling, (4) transporters, (5) ROS detoxication and (6) expression regulators and signalling pathway-related genes. We choose to include leaves data in this a transcriptomic evaluation focused on rootstocks selection. In this context, the genetic regulation of leaves is less signi /uniFB01 cant compared to the root system. Still leaves data can provide a more comprehensive overview of the genetic regulation mechanism of salt stress. In a previous study we evaluated the decrease in leaf chlorophyll content in salt-stressed citrus by monitoring SPAD measurements throughout the stress period (Bonnin et al., 2023). The decrease in SPAD values is only signi /uniFB01 cant for sensitive PO2x. Numerous studies have also reported that salt stress decreases chlorophyll content in sensitive genotypes (Khoshbakht et al., 2014; Hameed et al., 2021). However, no leaf symptoms were observed in the leaves of CL, nor any variation in SPAD value under salt stress. Similar to what we observed, Ben Yahmed et al. (2015) demonstrated that mandarin accessions such as ' Cleopatra ' and ' Shekwasha ' showed few leaf symptoms. According to these authors, for these genotypes, Cl -translocation from roots to leaves is limited. Accessions with the most severe foliar symptoms, such as ' Fuzhu ' , ' Willowleaf ' , ' Beauty ' , ' King of Siam ' and ' Nasnaran ' , have higher Cl -translocation from roots to leaves (Cl- leaf/root ratio). Other research (Brumo ́ s et al., 2009) has shown that, in CL mandarin, salt stress does not lead to the accumulation of toxic levels of chlorides in shoots. Finally, a study on the high-salinitytolerant rootstock (Foral-5) (Lo ́ pez-Climent et al., 2008) showed that the combination of an ef /uniFB01 cient Cl -exclusion mechanism and an active photosynthetic system can improve salt stress tolerance in this genotype. An interesting perspective to our work would be to study the potential of CL and CR rootstocks grafted with varieties of commercial interest (such as orange or mandarin). Improved ion restriction capabilities at root level should alleviate symptoms caused by salt stress.

## 4.1 Better cell wall strengthening under salt stress in CL4x

In salt stress condition, as ROS concentration increases (Apel and Hirt, 2004; Ahmad et al., 2013; AbdElgawad et al., 2016; Bonnin et al., 2023), it can also initiate the formation of radicals that may cleave sugar bonds in plant polysaccharides, causing cell wall loosening. Cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance is a factor of paramount importance for plants to tolerate perturbations in turgor and to reinforce cell walls in situations of high salinity (Feng et al., 2018; Colin et al., 2023). Reduced ability of plant cells to absorb water decreases cellular turgor pressure, thereby causing a retraction of plant tissues and extrusion of water from the plant cells (van Zelm et al., 2020). To overcome the osmotic stress, cell wall adjustment is required to adapt to reduced turgor pressure and altered CWI (Colin et al., 2023). Peroxidases can crosslink wall glycoproteins, such as extensins, as well as components of the secondary cell wall, such as lignins. The establishment of crosslinks between these components suggests strengthening of the cell wall. Activation of peroxidases involved in cell wall remodelling (Shen et al., 2014; Le Gall et al., 2015; Tenhaken, 2015; Novakovic ́ et al., 2018) could be a strategy to withstand osmotic changes caused by salt stress (Tenhaken, 2015). Many authors have noticed phenotypic differences between ploidy levels. These differences include increased cell volume and a more massive appearance of the organs (Ruiz et al., 2020). It has been demonstrated that leaves of polyploids could be thicker and exhibit greater photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content than 2x (Ruiz et al., 2020; Sivager et al., 2021; Lourkisti et al., 2022; Tossi et al., 2022). Roots of 4x genotypes are generally thicker and less branched, with less root development than those of 2x (Tossi et al., 2022). It is believed that these histological characteristics of roots could be associated with lower hydraulic conductivity. Such an ability may be an advantage to cope with the effects of salt stress. This is why it is thought that 4x citrus genotypes, once used as rootstocks, could provide a sustainable system to cope with the toxicity problem caused by ion excess. Previous studies have already demonstrated the relationship between phenotypic variation in the aerial part and stress resistance in polyploid citrus (Moya et al., 2003; Allario et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2020). In contrast, the role of the root system is poorly documented (Bonnin et al., 2023). If the maintenance of turgid cells is mostly dependent on water in /uniFB02 ux, cell collapse due to plasmolysis is mostly related to the thickness of the cell wall and maintenance of its integrity (Colin et al., 2023). Plants defective in cell wall synthesis and remodelling are typically hypersensitive to salt stress. In our study, co-regulated gene clusters related to cell wall remodelling were identi /uniFB01 ed in both PO and CL genotypes, potentially leading to cell wall modi /uniFB01 cations that might be relevant to salt response (Shen et al., 2014; Tenhaken, 2015; Byrt et al., 2018; Colin et al., 2023). In PO roots, gene clusters n°5 and 9 as well as gene cluster n°20 in CL leaves contained genes related to cell wall organisation, dynamics and modi /uniFB01 cation (Figure 4; Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, in these clusters, 4x genes were upregulated under salt stress, contrary to their 2x counterparts. Genes identi /uniFB01 ed in these clusters were encoded for expansin 1 (CITRE\_004g032280; cluster n°20 CL leaves) and extensin 3 (Ptrif.0005s2249; cluster°9 PO roots). We also found genes encoding for pectin methylesterase 17 (Ptrif.0003s4304; cluster n° 5 PO leaves) (Supplementary Table S2). Expansin proteins are known to have cell-wall loosening activity (Sampedro and Cosgrove, 2005). They could be involved in cell expansion and other developmental events during which cell-wall modi /uniFB01 cation occurs (Sampedro and Cosgrove, 2005; Chen et al., 2018; Backiyarani et al., 2022). Extensins are plant cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (Castilleux et al., 2021). They are responsible for cell wall reinforcement by forming intra- and intermolecular cross-links (Zhao et al., 2018). It is thought that formation of such cross-links requires appropriate glycosylation and structural conformation of the glycoprotein (Showalter et al., 1992; Tire ́ et al., 1994; Lamport et al., 2011; Castilleux et al., 2021). Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyse the removal of methyl groups from the homogalacturonan (HG) backbone (Hocq et al.,

2017; Del Corpo et al., 2020; Gigli-Bisceglia et al., 2022). An abundant literature agrees that pectin is a major polysaccharide of cell walls rich in galacturonic acid (GalA) (Jarvis, 1984; Mohnen, 2008; Bethke et al., 2016; Hocq et al., 2017). Moreover, HG could be considered the most abundant pectic polymer in plant cell walls (Wydra and Beri, 2006; Yapo et al., 2007; Atmodjo et al., 2011; Hocq et al., 2017). HG could partially be methyl-esteri /uniFB01 ed at the C6 atom of GalA (Micheli, 2001; Du et al., 2022). The degree and pattern of methylation could affect biomechanical properties of the cell wall by making pectin susceptible for enzymatic de-polymerization and enabling gel formation (Levesque-Tremblay et al., 2015). PMEs ' activity is modulated by a family of proteinaceous inhibitors known as pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs) (Levesque-Tremblay et al., 2015; Wormit and Usadel, 2018; Gigli-Bisceglia et al., 2022). In line with this, we found in cluster n°9 of PO roots a gene encoding for a PMEI (Ptrif.0005s0849; Supplementary Table S2). These results suggest that in CL leaves and PO roots, ploidy could improve cell wall maintenance and integrity during salt stress.

The CL4x strategy for cell wall remodelling could explain its improved salt tolerance. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that ionic imbalance induced by salt stress could also impact cell walls ' mechanical properties (Favreau et al., 2019, 2023; Colin et al., 2023). Indeed, salt stress might cause cell wall softening, notably through its effect on pectins (Beauzamy et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2018; Favreau et al., 2019, 2023). Plant cell wall pectins are typically secreted in a highly methyl-esteri /uniFB01 ed form and then selectively deesteri /uniFB01 ed by PMEs (Gigli-Bisceglia et al., 2022). When pectins are de-methylesteri /uniFB01 ed, they can be cross-linked by divalent cations, such as Ca 2+ . This promotes cell wall stiffness (Hocq et al., 2017; Colin et al., 2023). Excessive Na + concentration in the apoplastic region results in a competition with Ca 2+ to bind to pectin, thereby disturbing the cross-linking of pectin (Ngoue ́ mazong et al., 2011).

## 4.2 Speci /uniFB01 c biological mechanisms triggered by salt stress

The lack of common genes between the gene lists (Supplementary Figure S2) suggests that ploidy, stress and interactions between both factors might trigger various responsive molecular mechanisms at the cell level (Figures 6A, B). This could mean that in 4x, different signalling pathways and biological targets might be regulated by stress, ploidy or stress -ploidy interaction effects. This also suggests that in 4x, speci /uniFB01 c genes ' expression is modi /uniFB01 ed by functions of the synergetic effect of stress and ploidy. These genes can be discriminated from the speci /uniFB01 c stress- and ploidy-induced DEGs. In cluster n°9 PO leaves, genes were up-regulated under salt stress in 2x and 4x citrus at different amplitudes (Figure 4C). In this speci /uniFB01 c cluster, we noticed a certain number of GO terms related to epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (RNA-splicing). Alternative splicing (AS) is mediated by a large RNP complex known as the spliceosome. Spliceosomal pre-mRNA binding speci /uniFB01 city is mediated by members of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family. Many publications have already demonstrated that splice site selection could be involved in salt stress response (Ding et al., 2014; Filichkin et al., 2015; Feng et al.,

2018). In line with this, we identi /uniFB01 ed in PO leaves, cluster n°9, six genes related to the RNA-splicing function (Ptrif.0003s3334, Ptrif.0004s1700, Ptrif.0005s0128 and Ptrif.0005s0389, Ptrif.0009s2279, Ptrif.0002s2733), (Supplementary Table S2). These genes encode for PRP4 KINASE A (PRP4KA), MOS4-ASSOCIATED COMPLEX 7, MERISTEMDEFECTIVE (MDF)/DEFECTIVELY ORGANIZED TRIBUTARIES 2 (DOT2), ATROPOS (ATO), SERRATE (SE) and SWELLMAP1 (SMP1) proteins, respectively. PRP4KA is a putative spliceosome protein kinase (Kanno et al., 2018). It is known to be an important for AS and plant development. MOS4 is a core member of the nuclear MOS4-associated complex (MAC) implicated in pre-mRNA splicing (Johnson et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2022). ATO is known to be the homolog of human SF3a60 and S. cerevisiae PRP9, which are required for the formation of the spliceosome complex (Moll et al., 2008; Staiger and Brown, 2013). The MDF DOT2 gene encodes an SRrelated family protein required for meristem function and leaf vascularization. It is described as likely to be the homolog of the human SART1 and yeast snu66 splicing factor (Thompson et al., 2023). SE is a protein involved in the processing of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcripts. It is associated with various complexes with roles in different aspects of plant RNA metabolism. These roles include assemblies involved in transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, miRNA biogenesis and RNA degradation (Raczynska et al., 2014; Jozwiak et al., 2023). mRNA processing SMP1 and SWELLMAP2 (SMP2) are involved in recruiting the second-step splicing factors to the spliceosome (Clay and Nelson, 2005; Liu et al., 2016). This suggests the possible activation of spliceosome complex in both types of PO under salt stress.

Interestingly, the PO leaves cluster n°9 also contained several genes associated with the epigenetic regulation process. Indeed, we found three genes related to histone modi /uniFB01 cation of GO terms. These genes were the homolog of yeast ADA2 2A, SET domain protein 19, su(var) 3-9 homolog 3 and plant homologous to para /uniFB01 bromin (Ptrif.0001s1025, Ptrif.0002s1614, Ptrif.0005s0808 respectively). ADA2 2A encodes for histone acetyl transferase GCN5 and the associate co-activator ADA2 (Vlachonasios et al., 2021). ADA 2A is part of the SAGA complex, which modi /uniFB01 es nucleosomal histones through acetylation and other histone modi /uniFB01 cations (Moraga and Aquea, 2015). SET domain protein 19, su(var)3-9 homolog 3 is known to have methyltransferase activity. It generally targets speci /uniFB01 c lysine residues of histone H3 or H4 (Ng et al., 2007). Plant homologous to para /uniFB01 bromin is part of the PAF1 complex, which regulates gene expression within H3K27ME3-enriched chromatin (Park et al., 2010). These results could suggest that in polyploids, salt stress could trigger gene expression reprogramming through RNA splicing as well as epigenetic regulation.

## 4.3 Polyploidy enhanced speci /uniFB01 c biological mechanisms under salt stress

In PO leaves, genes strictly in /uniFB02 uenced by ploidy level were mostly related to post-translational regulation processes (Supplementary Figure S4A). In CL root genes strictly in /uniFB02 uenced by ploidy level, genes related mostly to signalling, transcriptional

regulation and regulation of the ROS response (Figure 6B). This result suggests that ploidy may in /uniFB02 uence gene expression regulation. It can trigger various regulation mechanisms, and expressions of stress-responsive genes. In CL roots, our analysis was strengthened by the identi /uniFB01 cation of speci /uniFB01 c genes. We identi /uniFB01 ed various expansin-related genes (CITRE\_006G018470, CITRE\_006G018470 and CITRE\_007G024720), an ascorbateoxidase gene (CITRE\_002G005950) and a putative CaM\_binding domain-containing protein (CITRE\_003G011190) (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Expansins are known to be key regulators of cell-wall extension, involved in the abiotic stress response. Salt stress triggers the reduction of shoot growth by inhibiting cell division and elongation (Le Gall et al., 2015). Expansins can allow plant cell walls to loosen. They also participate in biological processes involving plant hormones. ABA promotes radial expansion of cortical cells in the root meristem, resulting in a swollen primary root. Recent transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in cell wall organization or biogenesis were regulated by ABA, including expansin genes. Induction of expansin genes could rely on the ABA signalling pathway. This /uniFB01 nding deepens our understanding of the role of expansin salt stress response. Further investigations will be required to determine if, in this particular case, ABA signalling truly triggers regulation of expansin genes. It would be interesting to estimate quantitatively the expression of the various expansin genes and ABA-signalling factor of this study.

In a recent study on Poncirus trifoliata (Wei et al., 2020) also demonstrated that 4x trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.) exhibited enhanced salt tolerance in comparison with 2x counterparts. Similarly to what we found here, theses authors demonstrated that genes related to plant hormone signal transduction were enriched in 4x PO leaves. In addition, genes encoding different antioxidant enzymes were upregulated in 4x genotypes under salt stress. These results tend also corroborates our previous study, showing that 4x genotypes could accumulate higher levels of soluble sugars and proline but less ROS under salt stress compared to their 2x counterparts. A study on transcriptome analysis of salt tolerance of roots in diploid and autotetraploid citrus rootstock ( C. junos cv. Ziyang xiangcheng ) (Song et al., 2023) showed that chitin response-related genes were enriched in roots of autotetraploid. The 4x exhibited higher chitinases activity than the diploids under salt stress. These results indicate that in other citrus species, salt stress induced the activation of chitin pathway, thus reducing in ROS accumulation, eventually enhancing salt tolerance of 4x. We found few chitin-responses related genes (Supplementary Table S2) in 4x genotypes. It is thus possible that the stress modality applied in our experiment (90 mM NaCl) was not strong enough to effectively observe overexpression of these genes in our experiment. In the future, we would like to test a prolonged and more intense salt stress exposition.

## 5 Conclusion

Tetraploid citrus may hold great potential for rootstock breeding programs and germplasm enhancement, since they harbour better tolerance capacity. The reason underlying 4x ' s better tolerance could be ascribed to multiple mechanisms, which makes it dif /uniFB01 cult to study. Our results demonstrate that stress, ploidy and interaction between ploidy and stress target various gene sets ' responses, leading to a complex adaptation response.

Salt treatment we applied explains the differences obtained between control and stressed genotypes at physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic levels (). Other factors explaining the variability of the results are, in order of importance, genotype and ploidy level. Overall, this work highlights the increasing contrast between samples, depending on genotype and ploidy level, subjected to stress treatment versus control treatment. Our results tend to con /uniFB01 rm that genotype and ploidy in /uniFB02 uence salt stress tolerance in the varieties tested. All genotypes tested showed a downregulation of photosynthesis related processes. Tetraploids genotypes of PO and CL tends to show an enhancement of cell wall remodelling and ion transport related process.

In our previous work, we demonstrated that CL genotypes could have a better adaptive capacity than PO ones, especially the CL4x, even if tetraploidy enhanced tolerance of the sensitive trifoliate orange. If PO is sensitive to salt stress, it is tolerant to cold and CTV. It will be interesting to seek combined parent-tolerance capacity in the PO x CL hybrids and establish whether the 4x hybrids overcome their counterparts ' tolerance ability. In the long term, this knowledge could radically change our vision of plant adaptation, guide breeding programmes and improve tolerance to abiotic stress in citrus fruit.

Finally, it must be stressed that there are still many genes without annotation. Numerous genes are found to code for proteins of unknown function without orthologues in the Arabidopsis genome dataset. Identifying the function of these genes and therefore improving the annotation available for the citrus genome would certainly contribute to a better understanding of CL and PO response to salt stress.

The study of genetic determinants of salt stress tolerance in citrus fruit was approached by means of a large-scale transcriptomic study (RNA-seq). Using this method, our goal was to identify potential variants between CL, which are more resistant to salt stress, and the reference PO which is sensitive to salt stress that could be used to steer the rootstock breeding programs. Moreover, the development of epigenetic approaches on such polyploid plant material, would enable to better understand the genetic regulation mechanisms involved in the heritability traits of adaptation to salt stress.

MATERIALS
## 2 Materials and methods

## 2.1 Plant material and salt stress experiment

A transcriptomic experiment was performed on the same plant material and experimental design described in Bonnin et al. (2023). Brie /uniFB02 y, four free-standing citrus genotypes were selected (Supplementary Table S1). Diploid (2x) trifoliate orange ( P. trifoliata ) (Poncirus Pomeroy ICVN-0110081) (PO2x) and 2x Cleopatra mandarin ( C. reshni ) (ICVN-0110274) (CL2x) and their two doubled diploid counterparts, 4x trifoliate orange ( P. trifoliata ) (ICVN-01011106) (PO4x) and 4x Cleopatra mandarin (ICVN-0101110) (CL4x) were evaluated in leaves and roots under salt stress conditions. Even if our study aim to select rootstock better adapted to salt stress, leaves data can provide a more comprehensive overview of the genetic regulation mechanism of salt stress. Brie /uniFB02 y, plants selected for experimentation were divided into two blocks and watered once a week. Stressed plants were watered with a nutrient solution supplemented with salt (NaCl), and control plants were irrigated with nutrient solution only. Salt concentrations were steadily increased from 30 mM to 90 mM at increments of 20 mM per week and then stabilized at 90 mM.

## 2.2 Sample preparation and sequencing

Leaves and roots of the four citrus seedlings genotypes under the control and stressed conditions (90mM NaCl) were ground to a /uniFB01 ne powder in liquid nitrogen under the RNAse-free condition. RNA extraction was performed using the NucleoMag ® kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co.KU, Düren, Germany) with the KingFisher automated system (KingFisher Flex Puri /uniFB01 cation System, ThermoFisher Scienti /uniFB01 c, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol. RNA integrity and quality were checked on TapeStation, screentape D5000. RNAseq libraries were prepared to obtain labelled and matched sequences using UDI indexes, following the protocol and recommendations from the Illumina Truseq kit. The integrity and quality of the libraries were checked on TapeStation, screentape D5000 and assayed by qPCR. A /uniFB01 rst sequencing of the libraries was then performed to validate their quality using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing system at the Agap genotyping platform (Cirad, Montpellier). The equimolar pool of the libraries was then built up using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit from Illumina. Sequencing was performed on a 150-nt pair-end S4 /uniFB02 ow cell lane by MGX in Montpellier. The clustering and sequencing steps were performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using the SBS (Sequence By Synthesis) technique with NovaSeq Reagent Kits using the Illumina TruSeq RNA protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

## 2.3 Data quality control and analysis

A total of 2.135.095.822 pairs of paired end reads of 150 nucleotides were generated from an Illumina Novaseq 6000 for the 48 samples with a mean of 44.481.163 read-pairs per samples. The rate of trimmed base was 8.79% and after low length reads removal, 2.122.477.755 (99.4%) of the initial read pairs remain available for mapping. 95.4% of these reads were successfully mapped on the reference genomes using STAR, with a multimapping rate of 3.48%. 86.3% of the mapped reads were asigned to knows features and were used for counting. More details can be found in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figures S5, S6.

The quality of raw data from high-throughput sequencing was assessed by calculating different metrics, such as the quality of the sequences per base using the FastQC software (v.0.11.9). Our experimental design is described as follows: for each tissue (roots or shoots)/2 independent genotypes/2 ploidy levels/2 modalities (control/stress)/3 biological replicates (Supplementary Table S1). RNASeq sequences of 2x and 4x Poncirus trifoliata (PO2x and PO4x) were aligned on the PO as reference genome (Peng et al., 2020), while 2x and 4x Cleopatra mandarin (CL2x and CL4x) were aligned with CL genome (Droc et al., in press 1 ). Cutadapt [v3.5; (Martin, 2011)] was used to /uniFB01 nd and remove Illumina Trueseq adapter sequences, remove low-quality base pairs in 5 ' and 3 ' of each read based on a quality cut-off of 30 and discard resulting pairs of reads containing a read shorter than 50 bases. Poly-g tails were also removed using the nextseq-trim option with a cut-off of 20. STAR (2.7.3a) (Dobin et al., 2013) was used with default parameters to align the reads on the reference genomes. To obtain count matrices, featureCount function of the Subread tool was used (release 2.0.1, 10 May 2023), with the options -M and -fraction

to consider multi-mapped reads (Liao et al., 2013; Stark et al., 2019; Amarasinghe et al., 2020).

## 2.4 Statistical analysis for gene selection

Gene counts from each genotype and tissue were analysed using DESeq2 R package (Love et al., 2014). Genes with expression-level changes depending on the treatment, the ploidy level, or the interactions between the two factors, were selected using the likelihood ratio test (LRT), following the multifactorial design protocol in the DESeq2 R package as described in Favreau et al. (2023). Brie /uniFB02 y, the LRT was applied to simultaneously test all the treatments and levels according to the multifactorial model Stress + Ploidy + Stress x Ploidy. Signi /uniFB01 cant genes were selected at false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p -values &lt; 0.01 threshold. To evaluate the quality of the LRT selected genes and to explore the underlying structure of the selected gene set, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was run using the Mixomics R package (release 3.17) (Le ̂ Cao et al., 2011; Rohart et al., 2017). For each gene set, from the two genotypes and two tissues, three lists of genes were extracted: those responding only to each speci /uniFB01 c effect, ploidy and stress, and those responding to the interaction ploidy x stress.

Co-expression analysis was performed on the signi /uniFB01 cant genes, selected according to the multifactorial model. The coseq R package (Rau and Maugis-Rabusseau, 2018) was used through the DIANE (Cassan et al., 2021) package with a normal model, an arcsin data transformation, a number of clusters between 3 and 20 and a seed /uniFB01 xed to 100.

The non-parametric Kruskall Wallis test was used to determine whether, for a given set of groups, there was at least one that was different from the others When KW test was able to identify d differences between groups, it was required to know which variables was concerned. We therefore carried out a pairwise multiple comparison, by using Dunn ' s test (Dunn, 1973). KW and Dunn use the same ranks assigned to individuals to carry out their treatments.

## 2.5 Functional categorisation

Functional analysis of the genes was performed. Gene ontology (GO) associated with each gene was found using a combination of Interproscan (Jones et al., 2014) and blast best hit (Ward and Moreno-Hagelsieb, 2014) against the Viridiplantae subset of Uniprot SwissProt and TremBL. GO enrichment was then performed using the Cytoscape plugin BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005). For each list of genes, signi /uniFB01 cantly enriched GO terms were identi /uniFB01 ed using a hypergeometric test and a multiple test correction using the Benjamini and Hochberg FDR correction with a signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Thissen et al., 2002; Reiner et al., 2003; Ferreira, 2007; Green and Diggle, 2007; Stephanie, 2015). Enriched GO terms having similar functions were clustered using the Enrichment Map and AutoAnnotate plugins of the Cytoscape software (Isserlin et al., 2014; Kucera et al., 2016). Default parameters were applied for each plugin.

2025-10-28 16:19:38,478 - INFO - Using prompt: Extract all genotype and NCBI accession information from the scientific article below. You MUST follow these steps:

        STEP 1 - SYSTEMATIC READING:
        Read the ENTIRE article text carefully, section by section:
        - Abstract: Check for study overview and organism mentions
        - Introduction: Look for study context and varieties being investigated
        - Materials and Methods: PRIMARY source for genotypes and sample descriptions
        - Results: Check for any additional genotype details or data references
        - Discussion: May contain references to data deposition
        - Data Availability Statement: CRITICAL section for NCBI accessions
        - Supplementary Information references: Note what information is external
        - Acknowledgments: Sometimes contains data repository information
        - TABLES: Pay special attention to tables (often formatted with pipes |, dashes -, or aligned columns). Tables frequently contain:
            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context
        - LOW: Ambiguous mentions, incomplete information, or indirect references

        STEP 5 - SOURCE TRACKING:
        - "main text": Information in the primary article body
        - "supplementary file": Referenced in supplementary materials (but actual content not in provided text)
        - "data availability statement": In data/code availability sections
        - "methods appendix": In detailed methods/materials sections
        - "not found": Information explicitly missing from the document

## Introduction

Citrus, including species such as sweet orange, mandarin, lemon or grapefruit, is one of the most important fruit crops in the world, both in terms of fruit production and economical value. Many efforts have been carried out to characterize the genome sequence of the main Citrus species: the draft genome of sweet orange, Citrus sinensis , was released in 2012 (Xu et al. , 2013); more recently a high-quality reference genome sequence of a haploid clementine, C. clementina , as well as the genome sequences of mandarin ( C. reticulata ), pummelo ( C. maxima ), sweet orange ( C. sinensis ) and sour orange ( C. aurantium ) was obtained and compared (Wu et al. , 2014). Citrus fruits have been traditionally classified into different groups based on the use of molecular markers, although the phylogeny of the species is not yet clear due to the presence of numerous hybrids. Lineages that gave rise to the most modern cultivars are still under discussion (Nicolosi et al. , 2000).

The analysis of the transcriptome is a crucial step to characterize any species genome, and during the past years, these studies have been boosted by the development of RNA-Seq technique (Egan et al. , 2012; Wang et al. , 2009). This approach has been greatly used to improve functional annotation of model plants like Arabidopsis (Filichkin et al. , 2010; Ossowski et al. , 2008), rice (Lu et al. , 2010; Mizuno et al. , 2010) and poplar (Ko et al. , 2012), with outstanding results. Deep sequencing of the transcriptome has also been applied for the identification of candidate genes in processes of agronomical interest (Canales et al. , 2014; Chen et al. , 2013; Venu et al. , 2011), or to obtain markers for large scale genotyping (Haseneyer et al. , 2011; Scaglione et al. , 2012).

Transcriptome studies in citrus have been mostly focused on the characterization of physiological processes of high relevance

## Summary

Previous RNA-Seq studies in citrus have been focused on physiological processes relevant to fruit quality and productivity of the major species, especially sweet orange. Less attention has been paid to vegetative or reproductive tissues, while most Citrus species have never been analysed. In this work, we characterized the transcriptome of vegetative and reproductive tissues from 12 Citrus species from all main phylogenetic groups. Our aims were to acquire a complete view of the citrus transcriptome landscape, to improve previous functional annotations and to obtain genetic markers associated with genes of agronomic interest. 28 samples were used for RNA-Seq analysis, obtained from 12 Citrus species: C. medica, C. aurantifolia, C. limon, C. bergamia, C. clementina, C. deliciosa, C. reshni, C. maxima, C. paradisi, C. aurantium, C. sinensis and Poncirus trifoliata . Four different organs were analysed: root, phloem, leaf and flower. A total of 3421 million Illumina reads were produced and mapped against the reference C. clementina genome sequence. Transcript discovery pipeline revealed 3326 new genes, the number of genes with alternative splicing was increased to 19 739, and a total of 73 797 transcripts were identified. Differential expression studies between the four tissues showed that gene expression is overall related to the physiological function of the specific organs above any other variable. Variants discovery analysis revealed the presence of indels and SNPs in genes associated with fruit quality and productivity. Pivotal pathways in citrus such as those of flavonoids, flavonols, ethylene and auxin were also analysed in detail.

to fruit quality and productivity, especially of sweet orange, as it is the most important citrus fruit for the juice industry. Thus, several works analysed transcriptome changes during fruit ripening of C. Sinensis (Shalom et al. , 2014; Yu et al. , 2012; Yun et al. , 2012), and C. Paradisi (Patel et al. , 2014). RNA-Seq was also used to study the level of heterozygosity of sweet orange and its effect on gene expression (Jiao et al. , 2013). The transcriptome profiling of responses to huanglongbing infection of C. Sinensis (Martinelli et al. , 2012) and Xylella fastidiosa infection of C. reticulata (Rodrigues et al. , 2013) has been also addressed.

However, only a few works have been performed on nonfruit organs (Xu et al. , 2013), and most of the Citrus species have never been analysed. Therefore, in this work, we carried out RNASeq studies of 4 nonfruit organs (flower, leaf, root and phloem) from 12 citrus species, including key members from all main phylogenetic groups, providing a comprehensive view of the citrus transcriptome.

## Results and discussion

## Overview of RNA-seq analysis

Twenty-eight samples obtained from 4 different organs of 12 Citrus species (Table 1) were used for RNA-Seq analysis. The selected species constitute a wide representation of the Citrus genus, with species from the 5 main Citrus clusters (Nicolosi et al. , 2000): citron cluster including C. medica, C. limon and C. bergamia ; mandarin cluster including C. clementina , C. deliciosa and C. reshni ; pummelo cluster including C. maxima, C. paradisi, C. aurantium and C. sinensis ; micrantha cluster with C. aurantifolia; and Poncirus trifoliata , from the Poncirus cluster (Figure 1).

The organs analysed were root, phloem (bark), leaf and flower. Young leaves and flowers were collected from C. aurantifolia ,

RNA-SeqwascarriedoutasdescribedinExperimentalprocedures section, and the results are summarized in Table 2. Eight samples were sequenced with single fragment libraries and 50-bp reads, with an average number of 92.4 million reads per sample after quality trimming. The remaining samples were sequenced with paired-end libraries and 75-bp reads, and after quality trimming, the average number of reads per sample was 133.7 million.

Overall, a total of 28 libraries were constructed and sequenced and 3.42 billion reads were produced. After quality trimming to remove low-quality bases and reads, 3.4 billion reads remained, with a total of 235.6 Gb of useful sequence.

## Transcript assembly

To obtain a set of reference transcripts and genes, high-quality reads from all samples were mapped to the C. clementina reference genome sequence (Wu et al. , 2014) as described in Experimental procedures section. Mapped reads were the input

for the Transcript Discovery tool, using existing annotations from the Citrus Genome Database (http://www.citrusgenomedb.org/), but adding new transcripts or genes when suggested by mapped reads.

About 2592 million reads were mapped, with 585.2 million reads in pairs (19%), 1079.8 million broken in paired reads (35%) and 256.3 million of gapped reads (10%) (Table S1). The CLC transcriptome assembly tool was the only one that, in a comparative study with ABySS and Velvet, consistently returned large numbers of quality transcripts regardless of the reference used (Misner et al. , 2013).

About 341 million reads were mapped to exons resulting in 28 203 genes found and annotated. The average transcript size was 3048.8 bp, and the total transcriptome size was estimated in 77.3 Mb. As the C. clementina genome project annotation provided 24 533 genes (Wu et al. , 2014), 3326 new genes were discovered in this work (Figure 2). Most of the genes annotated by the international consortium were confirmed by the RNA-seq, except 3891 genes that had &lt; 10 reads and did not overcome the above background. From this group, 1086 genes produced corresponding citrus ESTs when a BLASTN search (Camacho et al. , 2009) was carried out against the EST section of the GenBank. On the contrary, 2805 predicted genes had no reads mapped and produced no ESTs, but they cannot be discarded as active genes because of the limited treatments and organs used in this work.

## Transcriptome annotation

Table 2 Sequencing results and quality filtering of reads

Figure 2 Summary of the transcriptome annotation compared with the ones from the genome projects of Citrus clementina (Wu et al. , 2014) and C. Sinensis (Xu et al. , 2013). The total number of genes, transcripts and genes with alternative splicing are shown for the 3 annotations.

A similar comparison with the C. sinensis genome project (Xu et al. , 2013) is more difficult to interpret, as the quality of the assembly is much lower and the number of scaffolds is very high, which has probably caused an overestimation in the number of genes (Figure 2). A de novo transcriptome analyses carried out in C. paradisi flavedo with six different assemblers followed by meta-assembly obtained 29 882 transcripts, with 17 129 ones provided by the CLC assembler (Patel et al. , 2014), which is in agreement with the results obtained in this work.

Our analysis reported 5619 genes with 1 transcript, while the number of genes with alternative splicing was 19 739 that had an average number of 2.9 transcripts per gene. 48 875 new alternative acceptor/donor sites and 39 879 new exons were found, with a total of 73 797 transcripts, with an average of 14038.7 reads and 849-fold coverage per transcript that strongly support these results. In a previous work based on the analysis of 1.6 million ESTs from different sources (Wu et al. , 2014), 3567 genes with alternative splicing producing 22 536 transcripts were described in C. clementina . Furthermore, the C. sinensis project identified 7640 genes alternatively spliced and 29 445 different transcripts using RNA-Seq (Xu et al. , 2013). Our analysis allowed the identification of 51 261 (3.0-fold increase) and 29 410 (1.7-fold increase) additional transcripts for clementine and sweet orange.

Therefore, this work provides an unprecedented view of the complexity of the transcriptome in Citrus species. Our results are in agreement with those works that evidence the substantial increase of sensitiveness of RNA-seq as related to cDNA sequence tag sequencing. Thus, deep transcriptome sequencing in Arabidopsis identified thousands of novel alternatively spliced mRNA

isoforms (Filichkin et al. , 2010), uncovered additional exons and previously unannotated 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions for pollenexpressed genes (Loraine et al. , 2013). Functional annotation of the rice transcriptome by RNA-seq identified 15 708 novel transcriptional active regions and found that ~ 48% of rice genes showed alternative splicing pattern (Lu et al. , 2010). Furthermore, 5877 unannotated transcripts were identified in stressinduced shoot and root (Mizuno et al. , 2010). Similarly, deep sequencing of Populus trichocarpa xylem transcriptome identified 27902 alternative splicing events, suggesting that at least 36% of the xylem-expressed genes in poplar are alternatively spliced (Bao et al. , 2013).

A Circos plot (Krzywinski et al. , 2009) showing the distribution of genes, transcripts and reads along the chromosomes of C. clementina , the reference genome, is presented in Figure 3. It is worth noting that gene-rich regions accumulate more transcripts and display higher levels of expression, while those with lowest gene density, like centromeric regions, show low expression levels. However, a total of 46 regions, 23 Mb of the genome, had an expression rate 1.5 times higher than the expected considering the number of genes or transcripts. On the contrary, 122 regions, comprising 61 Mb, showed a level of expression half of what could be expected. In Arabidopsis, for instance, it has been reported that physical location along the chromosome affects gene activity. Thus, genes in close proximity are much more likely to be co-expressed than would be expected by chance, while centromeric regions and other stretches had greatly reduced transcriptional activity (Schmid et al. , 2005).

In humans, it has also been described the presence of domains with a significant clustering of highly expressed or low-expressed genes, suggesting they are an integral part of a higher order structure in the genome related to transcriptional regulation (Versteeg et al. , 2003). Our results suggest a similar organization of the transcriptomic activity in Citrus species.

## Functional annotation of transcripts

The longest transcript from each gene was selected for functional annotation performed with Blast2GO (Conesa et al. , 2005), InterProScan (Jones et al. , 2014), EC enzyme codes and KEGG (Kanehisa et al. , 2014) pathways, which resulted in 24 502 transcripts annotated with GO terms and/or functional domains.

The annotation showed that 307 transcripts were classified as transposable elements (TEs) and therefore should not be considered as genes. Consequently, the number of real citrus genes should be closer to 27 530, than to 27 837 initially found. These TEs corresponded mainly to mutator-like (61), copia (51) or gypsy (8) elements, with 38 unclassified TEs. The fact that these transposable elements were found in the RNA-Seq analysis as well as the high number of reads mapped to them (1 183 654) indicates that they are very active in the citrus genome, an observation that may be in part related to the relevant number of spontaneous mutations that are found in citrus (Butelli et al. , 2012; De Felice et al. , 2009; Terol et al. , 2015).

The functional annotation obtained for the genes previously described was almost identical to the one reported by the International Citrus Consortium, available at phytozome (Goodstein et al. , 2012). Therefore, a summary of the annotation of the 3326 new genes is provided. Functional annotation was found for 1262 of these genes, while the rest remained as unknown. Thirtyseven new GO terms from 58 genes were added to the annotation, corresponding to 18 molecular functions, 15 biolog-

ical processes and 4 cellular components that were described for the first time in citrus. In other cases, the number of genes associated with a GO term increased remarkably, as is shown in Table S2. Homologs of 290 genes were described for the first time, including 29 transcription factors belonging to MADs box (29), ethylene responsive (2) or WRKY (2) families. A total of 139 enzymatic activities (ECs) from 65 different pathways were found and 10 of them were novel ones in citrus. The number of genes related to several enzymatic activities increased significantly (Table 3).

In summary, our analysis provides a significant improvement in the description of the citrus transcriptome, both in terms of new genes and new transcripts from known genes that will allow a better understanding of the genetic regulation controlling important biological processes that are responsible of desirable traits for citrus improvement.

## Differential expression analysis in organs

To perform differential expression analyses, RNA-seq reads were grouped by organ and mapped against the reference transcriptome (Table S1). Gene expression was assessed in each organ compared to the rest and genes were counted as expressed in an organ if a minimum of reads per kb per million reads (RPKM) of 1 was observed. The expression of 13 614 genes was detected in all four organs, while 1620, 294, 356 and 329 genes were exclusively expressed in flower, root, phloem and leaf organs, respectively (Figure 4).

The study of transcription factors (TFs) found a total of 409 genes belonging to the MYB (136), bHLH (72), WD40 (17), MADs (80), WRKY (55) and ERF (49) families. A total of 152 genes were expressed in all four organs, while 7, 4, 12 and 34 were leaf, phloem, root and flower specific, respectively (Table S3). This distribution might reflect the different regulatory roles of these factors in the analysed organs, in a similar manner that was found in peach (Wang et al. , 2013).

In a parallel approach, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were examined using the EdgeR package (Robinson et al. , 2010), and the results were filtered with a FDR P -value correction value &lt; 0.05 and a fold change value &gt; 1.5 or &lt; /C0 1.5. As a result, 4466, 631, 272 and 5825 genes were up-regulated, while 6273, 270, 41 and 6294 genes were down-regulated in leaf, phloem, root and flower, respectively. It was noticeable that the number of DEGs in phloem and root was one order of magnitude lower than in flower or leaf, however, when both tissues were grouped and compared against the other organs, a total of 3287 genes were found to be down-regulated and 3346 overexpressed, suggesting that root and phloem share many DEGs that are quenched when one organ is compared against the other. Our data support a correlation of gene expression in shoot and root that has been previously reported (Dash et al. , 2014; Kelly et al. , 2014; Sarkar et al. , 2007).

To evaluate the functional properties of the organ-specific genes, annotation enrichment analyses were carried out with the Fisher's exact test, considering those genes that where exclusive or overexpressed in a given organ. This way, 11, 14, 437 and 468 GO terms were significantly enriched in root, phloem, leaf and flower, respectively, that were in agreement with the main functions performed by the analysed organs (Figure 5).

Functional enrichment in flower was related to the morphogenesis of floral organs, the role of auxin in floral differentiation, pollen differentiation, tube development, etc. This enrichment was rather similar to that obtained in the analysis of the transcriptome during flower development in chickpea (Singh et al. , 2013).

About 367 genes with significant homology to TFs were overexpressed in flowers, including the most important regulatory families: bHLH (34), zinc finger (92), MADs box (30), MYB (40), homeo-box (36) or AP2/ERF (31). Some of them perform crucial roles during flower differentiation and development: CONSTANS (CO)that induces flower differentiation (Valverde, 2011);. the floral homeotic gene APETALA2 (AP2) (Jofuku et al. , 1994); AGAMOUS and Sepallata 1, 2 and 3; MADs box homeotic genes (G /C19 omez-Mena et al. , 2005; Pelaz et al. , 2000); or MYB transcription factor r2r3-myb that activates the biosynthesis of anthocyanins (Petroni and Tonelli, 2011).

Genes overexpressed in leaf displayed functions related to its development and the organization of photosynthetic machinery, photosynthesis itself, or response to stresses with the involvement

of the jasmonic and salicylic acid pathways. The number of TFs overexpressed in flower (367) was much larger than in leaf (248), probably reflecting the complexity of the regulatory pathways controlling the development of reproductive organs. On the contrary, the number of chloroplastic genes overexpressed in leaf (286) was more than 3 times larger than in flower (86).

A total of 35 cytochrome P450 genes were found to be overexpressed in leaf, an identical number that was found in a co-expression analysis of the cytochrome P450 superfamily in Arabidopsis, that showed an unexpectedly large subset of 35 P450 genes being mapped to pathways identified as 'plastidial isoprenoids', 'photosystems', 'photosynthesis' and 'biogenesis of the chloroplast' with very high expression in all green organs. These data might indicate that a number of plant P450 enzymes have functions related to primary photosynthetic metabolism for the synthesis of antioxidants, plastidial structural components, signalling molecules related to energetic metabolism or light perception (Ehlting et al. , 2008).

Fifty-four members of the family of genes coding for LRR receptor-like serine/threonine proteins were also highly expressed in leaf. These receptors play an important role in signalling during pathogen recognition and the subsequent activation of plant defence mechanisms (Afzal et al. , 2008). These data are in agreement with the enrichment in stress-response genes activated by jasmonic and salicylic acid. Actually, it has been found that genes encoding for receptor-like protein kinases are targets of pathogen, and salicylic acid-induced WRKY DNA-binding proteins in Arabidopsis (Du and Chen, 2000).

Differential expression in root and phloem is displayed by genes related to binding and transport of inorganic substances: nitrogen compounds, iron, copper, aluminium or calcium. Among the most highly expressed genes in root and phloem was the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene that is expressed in response to the oxidative stress caused by drought and salinity, the most serious abiotic stresses affecting citrus culture in the Mediterranean Basin (Gueta-Dahan et al. , 1997). Homologs of the Arabidopsis copper (Cu) chaperones, antioxidant protein1 (ATX1) and ATX1-like copper chaperone (CCH) were also highly expressed transcripts in root and shoot, which are required to maintain Cu homoeostasis to facilitate its use and avoid its toxicity (Shin et al. , 2012). A homolog to a two-pore calcium channel 1 (AtTPC1), gene that in Arabidopsis is part of a signalling system based on Ca2 + waves that contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance (Choi et al. , 2014), was also found.

The different expression profile of the four analysed tissues becomes evident in the principal component analysis (PCA) carried out with the 28 samples (Figure 6), which shows the correlation between the origin of the sample and the expression of the genes. On the contrary, no correlation is observed when the samples were grouped by species (Figure S1), except for the Poncirus ones, probably due to the larger genetic distance of this species with respect the other citrus. In fact, differential expression analysis between species using the same organ (data not shown) yielded very low number of DEGs, indicating that the organs and stages used in this work were not suitable for comparison studies between species.

In general, these results agree with the concept that gene expression is overall related to the physiological function of the specific organs, above any other consideration. Thus, our results are similar to those obtained in a comprehensive microarray study of the tomato transcriptome that identified 465 co-expression/ functional modules, and found differential expression in leaf, fruit and root (Fukushima et al. , 2012). In Arabidopsis, a genomewide expression analysis of 18 organ or tissue types showed that they had a defining genome expression pattern and that the degree to which organs share expression profiles was highly correlated with the biological relationship of organ types (Ma et al. , 2005). In a microarray study in Arabidopsis, the largest differences in gene expression were observed when comparing samples from different organs: on average, 10-fold more genes were differentially expressed between organs as compared to any other experimental variables (Aceituno et al. , 2008).

To validate the differential expression, 10 DEGs were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA extracted used in the RNA-Seq was also utilized in these experiments that were carried out as described in Experimental procedures. The genes and the primers used for PCR are shown in Table S4. The results obtained confirmed in all cases the differential expression observed with RNA-Seq, and all the analysed genes showed higher levels of expression in the tissues where they had been identified as DEGs (Figure S2).

## Metabolic pathways

The differential expression observed between the four organs can also be observed at the genomic level (Figure 7), as there were regions where gene expression in a specific organ was much higher than in the rest. We identified 41 regions that showed expression levels significantly higher than the average of the four tissues in that bin: 20 regions were overexpressed in flower, nine in leaf, seven in phloem and nine in root. Two regions showed simultaneous overexpression in leaf/flower and six in root/ phloem, indicating possible co-expression patterns.

Three relevant pathways were analysed in detail: flavonoids, auxin and ethylene biosynthesis. Flavonoids are plant secondary metabolites implicated in the control of auxin transport, defence, flower colouring, seed dispersal and many other processes (Brunetti et al. , 2013; Buer et al. , 2007; Taylor and Grotewold, 2005; Treutter, 2005). Auxin is a plant hormone involved in an extraordinarily broad variety of biological processes, such as cell polarity, cell cycle control and organ patterning (Luschnig, 2001; Sauer et al. , 2013). Finally, ethylene plays numerous roles in the development and environmental responses of the plant like germination, senescence, abscission or ripening, as well as stress

Poncirus is the only exception, as samples from the species are closer between them than with the ones from the same tissue.

and pathogen responses (Iqbal et al. , 2013; Merchante et al. , 2013). In addition, auxin and ethylene act synergistically to control root elongation and root hair formation, as well as antagonistically in lateral root formation and hypocotyl elongation (Muday et al. , 2012). In some of these processes, they regulate and/or interact with flavonoids (Buer et al. , 2006; Smith et al. , 2003).

Initially, the EC number was used to identify the enzymes involved in these 3 pathways in citrus. Then, the closest protein showing empirical evidences of its activity was used to perform a phylogenetic analysis with the citrus proteins (see an example in Figure S3). Only proteins clustering with the control sequences were considered for the analysed pathway, so the large initial number of proteins was reduced to a more accurate one. The transcriptional activity of the selected genes was estimated using the RPKM data obtained from the RNA-Seq.

levels compared with the other enzymes, with maximum values in flower; ACC synthase genes had the lowest expression, but were present in the 4 organs; ACC oxidase genes were also expressed in the four organs with low values, except for Ciclev10015962 that showed an expression peak in leaf. The rate-limiting step of ethylene synthesis is the conversion of SAM to ACC by ACC synthase: expression of the ACC synthase genes is highly regulated by a variety of signals and active ACC synthase is labile and present at low levels (Wang et al. , 2002). The low levels of expression of ACC synthase in citrus, as well as the variations found in the different genes and organs, would be in agreement with the role of regulation of ACC synthase in the control of ethylene levels. Differences in the regulation of ACC synthase isoforms have been already described in tomato (Barry et al. , 2000; Nakatsuka et al. , 1998).

In the flavonoid and flavonol biosynthetic pathway (Kanehisa et al. , 2014), 18 enzymatic activities were represented by 51 citrus genes (Figure S4). Chalcone-flavanone isomerase, which catalyses the formation of naringenin, and dihydrokaempferol 4-reductase, which forms final products for flavonoid biosynthesis, were highly expressed in flowers but at a very low level in the other organs. Actually, all essential enzymes catalysing the formation of naringenin, apiforol, luteforol and leucocyanidin were found in flower samples, except flavonoid 3 0 ,5 0 -dihydroxyflavanone, that was also produced in leaf and phloem. Our data would be in agreement with the relevant role of flavonoids in flowers and later in fruits (Hichri et al. , 2011).

For the ethylene biosynthesis route, 3 SAM-synthase, 5 ACC synthase and 3 ACC oxidase genes were found in citrus (Figure S5). The SAM-synthase displayed the highest expression

The synthesis of auxins in plants proceeds through both the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathways and the indole-3-acetamide (IAM) (Figure S6) (Mano and Nemoto, 2012). In the IPA pathway, two homologs for TAR, a gene coding for tryptophan aminotransferase, and six for YUC that encodes for flavin monooxygenase were identified. The higher level of expression of the genes from the IPA pathway in citrus would be in agreement with the fact that most of IAA in plants is produced through this pathway (Brumos et al. , 2014).

In the IAM pathway, homologs of AM1, which produces IAA from IAM, have been found in Arabidopsis and tobacco (Mano et al. , 2010), and we identified 9 putative homologs in citrus. Indole-3-acetamide (IAM) has also been found in Arabidopsis and other species, including Citrus unshiu (Takahashi et al. , 1975), and indole-3-acetamide hydrolase activity has been detected in crude extract from young fruits of P. trifoliata (Kawaguchi et al. ,

## 945

1991), indicating that IAM is a native compound and that the IAM pathway is operative in citrus. However, no clear homolog of the bacterial gene aux1/iaaM has been found in plants, including our analyses in citrus, despite of several evidences if its activity (Klee et al. , 1987).

## Variant analysis

RNA-seq has proven to be a suitable resource for the development of molecular markers in many species, including plants (Piskol et al. , 2013; Severin et al. , 2010). The improvement of RNA-seq de novo assembly has been especially useful for species with no genome sequence available like onion, Allium cepa (Kim et al. , 2014); rye, Secale cereale (Haseneyer et al. , 2011); red clover, Trifolium pratense (Yates et al. , 2014); or artichoke, Cynara cardunculu s (Scaglione et al. , 2012).

A major benefit of RNA-seq in SNP calling relative to whole genome sequencing is the reduction in the effective size of the genome. Utilization of RNA-seq requires much less sequence depth to identify the majority of the variants in medium to highly expressed transcripts relative to whole genome sequencing. This advantage has been used, for example, to explore genetic variability in a large number of populations and varieties from Zea mays (Hansey et al. , 2012) or Brassica rapa (Devisetty et al. , 2014; Paritosh et al. , 2013). Validation of SNPs by different methods showed rates higher than 90% indicating the accuracy of this method (Devisetty et al. , 2014; Hansey et al. , 2012; Scaglione et al. , 2012).

For our variant calling analysis, read samples were grouped by species and proceeded as described in the Experimental procedure section. Results are summarized in Table 4. A total of 6.5 million high-quality variants were found, including 5.74 million SNPs and 534 thousand indels. The number of variants ranged from 220 557 in C. clementina to 905 707 in C. aurantifolia a difference proportional to the phylogenetic distance of each species with respect to the haploid C. clementina used as the reference genome. Approximately 890 000 variants, 14% of the total, were privative of the 12 species, and again for each one, the number of privative variants reflected the phylogenetic distance with respect to clementine.

Analysis of the SNP set shows that transitions (60%) were more abundant than transversions (40%), and the most abundant changes were the transitions C/T and A/G, with about more than 990 000 each, independently of the species analysed.

As the reference used was the haploid clementine genome, the only possible variants are heterozygous, and therefore, the expected number of homozygous variants in the clementine samples should be 0. However, a total of 38 809 homozygotic variants were found in our samples, suggesting the presence of false positives. Further analysis showed that in all these positions, the alternative allele was in a proportion of reads higher than 85%, with reads in both strands, revealing mistakes in the Sanger sequencing (Figure S7).

An investigation of the heterozygosity in C. sinensis identified 226 000 SNPs and 47 700 indels in 17 765 protein-coding loci annotated in the sweet orange genome and predicted that 32 460 SNPs potentially affect gene function (Jiao et al. , 2013). In our work, we identified 436 196 SNPs and 41 139 indels, affecting 13 664 genes, probably due to the fact that the haploid C. clementina genome sequence was used as reference, which would increase significantly the number of variants.

We analysed the effect of the variants on the coding regions and found that a total of 20 328 genes displayed changes in

the coding regions. C. deliciosa with 9038 genes affected had the lowest number, while C. aurantium with 16 736 genes had the largest one. A large number of changes on the coding regions were privative of each species that could be interesting targets for the development of markers associated with differential traits.

Overall, the variant analysis performed in this work provides a valuable resource of genetic markers close to or within coding sequences that make them especially useful for citrus breeding programs. Furthermore, for 6 of the species, C. medica , C. limon , C. bergamia , C. paradisi , C. aurantifolia and P. trifoliata , this is the first genomewide set of markers described so far, which increases the value of the results obtained in our work.

## Conclusions

In this study, we have used deep RNA-Seq of 12 species using 4 different organs, which provided enough coverage for the discovery of unknown transcripts, the exponential increase in the quantity of transcript variants, the detection of a large number of polymorphisms and an update of existing annotation.

## Experimental procedures

## Plant material

Vegetal material was obtained from C. aurantifolia (Mexican lime), C. aurantium (Sevillano sour orange), C. bergamia (Bergamota de Reggio Calabria), C. clementina (Clemenule s mandarin ), C. deliciosa (Willowleaf mandarin), C. limon (Fino lemon), C. maxima (Deep Red pummelo), C. medica (Diamond citron), C. paradisi (Star Ruby grapefruit), C. reshni (Cleopatra mandarin), C. sinensis (Navelina sweet orange) and P. trifoliata (Rubidoux). The four organs analysed were leaf (young and fully developed), phloem (bark from last sprout and old branches), root (young secondary roots) and flowers (complete flowers in anthesis). Flowers at different developmental stages -green button, white button, petals elongation and anthesis -were collected from C. clementina (Table 1). Samples were stored at /C0 80 ° C until RNA extraction.

## RNA extraction

Total RNA was isolated from frozen organs using acid phenol extraction and lithium chloride precipitation method as described in Ecker and Davis (Ecker and Davis, 1987). PolyA RNA was isolated with RNEASY TM kit from Qiagen, following provider's protocol. Purified polyA RNA was diluted in 100 l L of free RNAase water and quantified using Nanodrop.

## Illumina TruSeq TM RNA sequencing library preparation

Libraries from total RNA were prepared using the TruSeq TM RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.5 l g of total RNA was used for polyA-based mRNA enrichment selection using oligo-dT magnetic beads followed by fragmentation by divalent cations at elevated temperature resulting into fragments of 80 -250 nt, with the major peak at 130 nt. First-strand cDNA synthesis by random hexamers and reverse transcriptase was followed by the second-strand cDNA synthesis performed using RNAseH and DNA Pol I. Double-stranded cDNA was end-repaired, 3 0 adenylated and the 3 0 -'T' nucleotide at the Illumina adaptor was used for the adaptor ligation. The ligation product was amplified with 15 cycles of PCR.

## Sequencing, base calling and quality trimming

Paired end libraries: Each library was sequenced using TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS, in paired-end mode with the read length 2 9 76 bp. A minimum of 50 million paired-end reads for each sample were generated on HiSeq2000 (Illumina, Inc) following the manufacturer's protocol. Images analysis, base calling and quality scoring of the run were processed using the manufacturer's software Real Time Analysis (RTA 1.13.48) and followed by generation of FASTQ sequence files by CASSAVA. Low-quality bases with a Phred score lower than 13 (base-calling error probability limit = 0.05) were removed with CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.3. All the reads are available at ENA, study accession number PRJEB6342.

## Transcript discovery

A set of reference transcripts and genes was inferred after reads from all samples were mapped to the C. clementina reference genome using the large gap mapper tool and Transcript Discovery Plug-in from CLC-Bio Genomics Workbench 7.0.3 with default parameters. Previous annotation of the clementine genome was used; therefore, the existing gene and mRNA annotations were kept and new ones added only when the mapped reads suggested a new transcript or gene.

## Functional annotation

Blast2Go (Conesa et al. , 2005) was used for functional annotation of the longest transcript from each gene. Sequences were also searched for conserved protein domains with IPRscan 5.0 (Jones et al. , 2014) using the Blast2Go suite.

## RNA-Seq and differential expression analyses

RNA-Seq analysis was carried out by mapping next-generation sequencing reads and counting and distributing the reads across genes and transcripts with CLC-Bio Genomics Workbench 7.0.3 tool (Mortazavi et al. , 2008), with default parameters. The genome sequence of C. clementina annotated with the results of the transcripts detection analyses was the reference. Differential expression studies were carried out with EdgeR package (Robinson et al. , 2010) with a total read count filter of 5 and P -values with FDR correction. Samples were grouped based on the organ they were collected from.

## qRT-PCR analysis

RNA extractions were performed as described above and RNA concentration was determined by fluorometric assays in triplicate using RiboGreen dye (Molecular Probes Eugene, Oregon) following the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was performed with a LightCycler 2.0 Instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) equipped with LightCycler Software version 4.0 as described previously (Agust /C19 ı et al. , 2007). Transformation of fluorescence intensity data into relative mRNA levels was carried out using a standard curve constructed with a 10-fold dilution series of a single RNA sample. The relative expression level of each gene was calculated using the 2DD CT (cycle threshold) method, and CitUBQ was used as an internal control (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Specificity of the amplification reactions was assessed by postamplification dissociation curves and product sequencing. Results were expressed as contrasts between compared tissues. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers and the size of the resulting fragments are listed in Table S4.

## Variants discovery

Fixed Ploidy Variant Detection tool from CLC-Bio Genome Workbench was used for variant discovery, mainly SNPs and indels. The parameters were set for an expected ploidy of 2, a required variant probability of 90%, a minimum coverage of 10 and a minimum frequency for the alternative allele of 20%. Base quality of the variant position and of the 5 neighbour up- and downstream positions was set to 20 and 15, respectively, to filter the results. The amino acid changes caused by the variants were also determined when they were located at coding regions, focusing on nonsynonymous changes, using the tool from CLCBio Genome Workbench.

The four organs analysed were leaf (young and fully developed), phloem (bark from last sprout and old branches), root (young secondary roots) and flowers (complete flowers in anthesis). Flowers at different developmental stages -green button, white button, petals elongation and anthesis -were collected from C. clementina (Table 1). Samples were stored at /C0 80 ° C until RNA extraction.
METHODS
## Experimental procedures

## RNA extraction

Total RNA was isolated from frozen organs using acid phenol extraction and lithium chloride precipitation method as described in Ecker and Davis (Ecker and Davis, 1987). PolyA RNA was isolated with RNEASY TM kit from Qiagen, following provider's protocol. Purified polyA RNA was diluted in 100 l L of free RNAase water and quantified using Nanodrop.

## Illumina TruSeq TM RNA sequencing library preparation

Libraries from total RNA were prepared using the TruSeq TM RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.5 l g of total RNA was used for polyA-based mRNA enrichment selection using oligo-dT magnetic beads followed by fragmentation by divalent cations at elevated temperature resulting into fragments of 80 -250 nt, with the major peak at 130 nt. First-strand cDNA synthesis by random hexamers and reverse transcriptase was followed by the second-strand cDNA synthesis performed using RNAseH and DNA Pol I. Double-stranded cDNA was end-repaired, 3 0 adenylated and the 3 0 -'T' nucleotide at the Illumina adaptor was used for the adaptor ligation. The ligation product was amplified with 15 cycles of PCR.

        CRITICAL REMINDERS:
        - Extract ONLY information present in the article text above
        - DO NOT use external knowledge or make assumptions
        - If information is missing, use null and explain in notes
        - Include evidence_text for medium/low confidence entries
        - ALWAYS output your reasoning process first (=== REASONING PROCESS === section), then the JSON
        - The reasoning section helps ensure accuracy and allows validation of your extraction logic
        - For tables: Process systematically row-by-row, don't skip entries
        - For ambiguous cases: State your interpretation in reasoning, then reflect uncertainty in confidence level
        - Validate JSON format: Ensure all braces, brackets, and commas are correct
        - NO markdown code blocks (no ```json), NO additional commentary - just reasoning section followed by raw JSON

2025-10-28 16:29:33,427 - INFO - Using prompt: Extract all genotype and NCBI accession information from the scientific article below. You MUST follow these steps:

        STEP 1 - SYSTEMATIC READING:
        Read the ENTIRE article text carefully, section by section:
        - Abstract: Check for study overview and organism mentions
        - Introduction: Look for study context and varieties being investigated
        - Materials and Methods: PRIMARY source for genotypes and sample descriptions
        - Results: Check for any additional genotype details or data references
        - Discussion: May contain references to data deposition
        - Data Availability Statement: CRITICAL section for NCBI accessions
        - Supplementary Information references: Note what information is external
        - Acknowledgments: Sometimes contains data repository information
        - TABLES: Pay special attention to tables (often formatted with pipes |, dashes -, or aligned columns). Tables frequently contain:
            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context
        - LOW: Ambiguous mentions, incomplete information, or indirect references

        STEP 5 - SOURCE TRACKING:
        - "main text": Information in the primary article body
        - "supplementary file": Referenced in supplementary materials (but actual content not in provided text)
        - "data availability statement": In data/code availability sections
        - "methods appendix": In detailed methods/materials sections
        - "not found": Information explicitly missing from the document

        STEP 6 - REASONING OUTPUT (MANDATORY):

        FULL TEXT
Background Belonging to the Rutaceae family, the Aurantioideae subfamily encompasses a variety of species, including Citrus sinensis and its related genera [ 1 ]. Oranges and their products are greatly appreciated for their nutritional, economic, and cultural advantages. Orange juice is one of the most beloved drinks [ 2 ]. It is widely known that tangerine peels have healing properties for medical purpose [ 3 ]. Fossil records from the late Miocene epoch in Lincang city, Yunnan province of China, suggest that a progenitor of the Citrus spp. have evolved approximately 8 million years ago [ 4 ]. Citrus plants, including oranges, lemons, and mandarins, are grown in more than 140 countries [ 5 , 6 ]. Citrus growers are highly concerned about the outbreaks of citrus diseases, including Huanglongbing (HLB), which is the most devastating citrus disease [ 7 ]. P. trifoliata is often used as rootstock for C. sinensis and has displayed a certain level of tolerance to HLB [ 8 ]. Unfortunately, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, Ca . L. africanus, and Ca . L. americanus, which are the causal agent of HLB, are yet to be cultured and there are no HLB-resistant citrus varieties [ 9 ]. The inability to culture the HLB pathogens renders it difficult to investigate the pathogenesis [ 10 ]. In addition, various issues need addressing, including yield, flavor, ripening time, stress resistance or tolerance, and mutation [ 11 ]. With the rapid progress of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, a vast quantity of Citrus transcriptome data has been collected, offering researchers the opportunity to address many challenging questions. In the past decade, the advancement of NGS has generated a large amount of sequence data [ 12 ]. By 2023, more than 2,400 samples of Citrus spp. have been published in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database [ 13 , 14 ]. In recent years, RNA-seq technology has been increasingly used to investigate various aspects of Citrus spp., such as gene expression changes caused by HLB [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 – 20 ]. Researchers have utilized this technique to build co-expression networks for analyzing core transcription factors in citrus development and stress responses [ 21 , 22 ]. However, raw data for RNA-seq is scattered across multiple databases, including SRA, European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and Genome Sequence Archive (GSA), making access difficult [ 23 ]. Furthermore, the data is often fragmented. As data growth continue to accelerate, there is a need for a standardized and simplified method of accessing gene expression data [ 24 ]. Recently, numerous online databases have been established, including CPBD [ 25 ], NGDC [ 26 ], TeaPGDB [ 27 ], BarleyExpDB [ 24 ], PlantcircBase [ 28 ], GRooT [ 29 ], PHI-base [ 30 ], and MPDB [ 31 ]. Notebly, these databases not only store data, but also offer various tools for analyzing biological data, such as BLAST [ 24 , 25 ]. TeaPGDB, for example, is a user-friendly platform for tea plant genome, providing access to seven tea genome sequences and five tool sets, including “Gene Search”, “BLAST”, “JBrowse”, “SSR” and “Download” [ 27 ]. PlantcircBase is a database that consolidates all plant-circRNA data [ 28 ]. Importantly, BarleyExpDB contains transcriptional profiles of barley across various growth and developmental stages, tissues, and stress conditions [ 24 ]. These databases are useful for analyzing the intricate regulatory mechanisms of various organisms. Despite the availability of multiple genomes of available. sinensis, a comprehensive and centralized database of RNA-seq datasets for Citrus spp. is still lacking. In this study, we have created OrangeExpDB, a database containing transcriptome data from 1,638 samples of five citrus species including C. limon , C. maxima , C. reticulata , C. sinensis , and P. trifoliata (Table 1 ). The expression profiles of genes in various tissues, developmental stages, and stress conditions can be easily downloaded and utilized. OrangeExpDB empowers researchers to access citrus RNA-seq data, thus facilitating the subsequent study of critical questions related to citrus. Table 1 Statistics of BioProjects and BioSamples of Citrus spp. in this study Species BioProjects BioSamples Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck 61 920 Citrus limon (L.) Burm. 11 117 Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr. 28 294 Citrus reticulata Blanco 19 182 Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. 15 125 Construction and contents Species selected Our database includes five species of Citrus: C. sinensis , C. limon , C. maxima , C. reticulata , and P. trifoliata . C. maxima , C. sinensis , C. limon , and C. reticulata are severely affected by HLB [ 32 , 33 , 34 – 35 ], whereas P. trifoliata is often used as a rootstock and shows tolerance to HLB [ 8 ]. Therefore, we chose the five representative citrus species to construct the database. Acquisition of reference genomes The Citrus Pan-Genome to Breeding Database (CPBD; http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/download.php ) [ 25 ] provides reference genomes and annotation information for C. maxima ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/data/Genome_info/HWB.v1.0/HWB.v1.0.genome.fa ), C. reticulata ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/data/Genome_info/JZ.v1.0/JZ.v1.0.genome.fa ), and C. sinensis ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/data/Genome_info/SWO.v3.0/SWO.v3.0.genome.fa ). The reference genome and annotation information of P. trifoliata was downloaded from the Phytozome database v13 ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Ptrifoliata_v1_3_1 ). Genome sequences and annotation information of C. limon are available at citrusgenomedb ( https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/Analysis/1470607 ). BioProjects and BioSamples OrangeExpDB was created by collecting RNA-seq data from five species, resulting in a total of 134 studies (Table 1 ). C. sinensis had the highest number of studies at 61, followed by C. maxima with 28, C. reticulata with 19, P. trifoliata with 15, and C. limon with 11. The datasets for each species were categorized into several groups based on stages/tissues, mutants, and stress treatments. Collection and option To streamline the screening process, we compiled information from NCBI and relevant literature, including project names, sample names, and library names. We also renamed some samples, of which the names were with unclear or ambiguous meanings, after checking relevant literature. Descriptions of each project were obtained. The RNA-seq raw data was downloaded from the NCBI SRA database and converted to fastq format using SRA toolkit v2.10.9 [ 36 ], resulting in a total of 1,638 samples (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Adaptor and low-quantity sequences in the fastq files were removed using trimmomatic v0.39 [ 37 ]. HISAT2 was used to build the index for genomic assembly and comparison of RNA-seq reads. The resulting file was in SAM format, which was processed using samtools v1.13 with parameters ‘bS’ and ‘sort’ [ 38 ]. Finally, stringtie v2.2.1 and a self-written Python script ( https://github.com/Viper-Chang/Batch-analysis-of-transcriptome-data ) were used to extract the expression matrix of FPKM [ 39 ]. In order to provide convenience to users, we have also uploaded the TPM values of all genes for each species in our database at “DOWNLOAD” page. The heatmap on the webpage was created using plotly [ 40 ]. The matrix was stored, maintained and operated using MySQL v5.6.50 (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 The procedure for creating the OrangeExpDB database. Raw sequencing data of RNA-seq studies were obtained and filtered, then aligned with the reference genome, resulting in a gene expression matrix. Gene functional information was subsequently annotated and functional modules such as “Blast”, “Search” and “Download” were added to the OrangeExpDB website Database commons and interface Our web server is hosted on Tencent Cloud’s lightweight application server, which is equipped with four Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8255 C CPUs clocked at 2.50 GHz and 8 GB of RAM. Access to the website is free of charge, as our purpose is not commercial. The Operating System (OS) running on the server is CentOS v7.9 ( http://www.centos.org ), a Linux-based OS. The web interface was designed using HTML ( https://www.w3.org/html/ ), JavaScript ( https://www.javascript.com/ ) and CSS ( http://www.w3.org ). The server-side back-end was encoded using PHP, and scripts were written in PHP to search data from MySQL and retrieve it to the front-end (Fig. 1 ). Community module Home OrangeExpDB provides access to five citrus reference genomes including C. sinensis (reference genome: Citrus sinensis v3.0), C. limon (reference genome: C. limon _EMF-UC_v1-Primary_genome), C. maxima (reference genome: Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck.cv.‘Cupi Majiayou’ v1.0), C. reticulata (reference genome: Citrus reticulata v1.0) and P. trifoliata (reference genome: Poncirus trifoliata v1.0). Each study is provided with a tag containing a summary of the study (Fig. 2 A). A search box allows users to query gene expression of interest, accommodating up to 500 genes at a time. For more than 500 genes, users can submit multiple queries or download the raw data to extract the desired information (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 An overview of OrangeExpDB database.

            * Sample/accession mappings (e.g., "Sample ID | Cultivar | Accession")
            * Genotype lists with corresponding metadata
            * Sequencing run information with SRA/BioSample IDs
            * Look for column headers like: Sample, Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Accession, BioProject, SRA, BioSample, Run ID

        STEP 2 - INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION:
        Target Information to Extract (ONLY from the provided text):
        a) Genotypes: cultivar names, variety names, breeding lines, strain identifiers, clone designations, wild-type references, mutant names, genetic backgrounds, germplasm accessions
        b) NCBI Accessions: BioProject IDs (PRJNA*), SRA IDs (SRR*, SRX*, SRP*), BioSample IDs (SAMN*, SAMD*, SAME*), GEO IDs (GSE*, GSM*), GenBank accessions

        SPECIAL ATTENTION TO TABLES:
        - Tables may appear as:
            * Pipe-delimited format: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
            * Space-aligned columns with headers and data rows
            * CSV-like format with commas
            * Mixed format with irregular spacing
        - Look for table indicators: "Table X", "Table X.", numbered tables, or section headers like "Sample Information"
        - Common table column headers that contain target information:
            * Genotype columns: Cultivar, Variety, Genotype, Strain, Line, Clone, Accession (germplasm), Sample Name, Material
            * NCBI columns: SRA, BioSample, Run, Accession, GEO, GenBank, BioProject ID
        - Read tables row by row, extracting genotype-accession pairs from each row
        - If a BioProject is mentioned before/after the table, it applies to all entries in that table

        STEP 3 - ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS:
        - Link each genotype with its corresponding NCBI accession when both are present
        - If multiple genotypes share the same accession series, create separate entries
        - Note any ambiguities in associations
        - HANDLE EDGE CASES:
            * Multiple organisms: Create separate entries for each organism-genotype-accession combination
            * Replicates: If same genotype has multiple accessions (biological/technical replicates), create one entry per accession
            * Pooled samples: If multiple genotypes are pooled into one accession, create one entry and note pooling in evidence_text
            * Wild-type vs mutants: Treat as distinct genotypes (e.g., "Col-0" vs "Col-0 mutant X")
            * Genotype synonyms: If article uses multiple names for same genotype, choose the most specific/official name

        STEP 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
        - HIGH: Explicit mention with clear association between genotype and accession
        - MEDIUM: Genotype clear but accession referenced elsewhere, OR accession clear but genotype inferred from context

        FULL TEXT
Background Plants harbor a high diversity of microorganisms proximal to, on, and inside their tissues. These microorganisms, which mostly include bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, form microbial communities that are associated with various plant habitats, including the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, phyllosphere, and endosphere, and the communities are collectively known as plant microbiomes [ 1 , 2 – 3 ]. The plant microbiome can determine the fate of plants in multiple ways, including (i) supplying plants with nutrition, e.g., nitrogen fixation or phosphate solubilization; (ii) modulating plant growth or relieving stress through phytohormone production or degradation; (iii) maintaining plant health through competition with pathogens or induction of plant resistance [ 4 , 5 , 6 – 7 ]; and (iv) driving the evolution of multi-disease resistance during long-term coevolution history [ 8 ]. Given its importance, the microbiome is considered an integral component of the plant-host assemblage, which is recognized as a “holobiont” [ 4 ]. Understanding the plant microbiome will have important implications for the human food supply and its security, biodiversity, and ecosystem functionality [ 9 , 10 ]. The plant microbiome is predominantly assembled from external inoculum pools, including soil- and air-borne microbial communities [ 6 ]. Soil is the largest known reservoir of microbial diversity [ 11 ], and roots are the primary site for plant-microbe interactions. Recently, several studies were performed to reveal the assembly mechanisms of the plant root-associated microbiome [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 – 17 ]. Based on these studies, a three-step enrichment model is proposed for the root-associated microbiome assembly process. Briefly, a fraction of microorganisms in the bulk soil inoculum pool are enriched toward the roots by the general gradients of carbon source, phytochemicals, pH, oxygen, and nutrients imposed by the roots, and these form the rhizosphere microbiome. Secondly, a more specialized community is further enriched on the rhizoplane; more intimate microbe-host interactions occur and much stronger selection pressure from the plant host is applied at the assembled rhizoplane microbiome than the rhizosphere microbiome. Finally, certain microorganisms enter and inhabit the endorhiza, and the established endorhiza microbiome contributes significantly to plant fitness, including immune system modulation [ 5 ]. Therefore, among the three root-associated layers described above, the rhizoplane is a key component serving a critical gating role that controls microbial entry into plant roots. However, these previous studies were mainly dedicated to revealing the effects of the plant genomic background on the microbial community assembly process [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 – 17 ]; how the enrichment process of the microbiome is affected by biotic stresses such as disease remains elusive. In addition, the studies were conducted using annual plants including Arabidopsis , soybean, barley, wheat, cucumber, and rice. Compared to the short lifespan of annual plants, perennial plants are subjected to longer periods of plant-microbe interactions for a single generation, including complicated root growth patterns and variable environmental factors. Compared to annual plants, the microbiome assembly cues of perennial plants are less studied. Here, we investigated the microbial community assembly process of the root-associated microbiome of citrus, a perennial plant, and how Huanglongbing (HLB) affects the microbiome enrichment process. HLB is the most devastating citrus disease worldwide [ 18 , 19 ]. The disease is caused by the gram-negative, phloem-limited, alpha-proteobacteria Candidatus Liberibacter spp., i.e., Ca. L. asiaticus (Las), Ca. L. africanus (Laf), and Ca. L. americanus (Lam) [ 18 , 19 ]. HLB impairs phloem transportation of photoassimilates [ 18 ] and causes root decline [ 20 ]. Las living in the phloem prevents direct interactions with other microbes on the rhizoplane and in the rhizosphere. Instead, Las causes decreased photoassimilate transportation, likely reducing plant resource availability for the root-associated microbiome. Our previous results suggested that HLB significantly altered the structure or functional potential of the citrus endosphere (leaves or roots) or rhizosphere bacterial community based on cultivation, 16S rDNA clone library, PhyloChip, or the GeoChip method [ 21 , 22 , 23 – 24 ]. However, the low-throughput-based methods used in these previous studies limited our understanding of the citrus microbiome. Additionally, these studies focused on the bacterial community colonized on a single layer, either the rhizosphere or endosphere. How HLB affects the microbiome assembly process, particularly the process from the less tightly associated rhizosphere to the rhizoplane component, of the citrus root-associated microbiome remains unknown. In this study, we obtained snapshots of the citrus root microbiome using metagenomic (MG) and metatranscriptomic (MT) approaches to investigate the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane-enriched taxa and functions and how HLB affects those enriched taxonomic and functional attributes. Methods Sample collection Three healthy and three Las-infected 11-year-old “midsweet” sweet orange on Swingle citrumelo rootstock from a grove at Auburndale (28.11 N, 81.79 W), Florida, USA were identified based on visual symptoms and qPCR results [ 24 ] from both leaf and root samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S1). The fine root cores (i.e., roots with approximately 2-cm-thick adjacent soil layers) from four corners of each tree were collected for DNA and RNA extraction. The loosely attached soil on the roots was removed with gentle shaking. The rhizosphere soil was carefully and quickly collected by gently brushing the remaining soil adhering to the roots using brush pencils. The soil collection step was performed on ice. Then, the roots were placed in pre-cooled PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) buffer, and the rhizoplane soil was extracted by ultra-sonication as described by Edwards et al. [ 17 ]. The roots were sonicated twice for 20 s each (time interval 5 s) using a sonication bath (power 130 W, 60 Hz, Fisher Scientific). The roots were discarded, and the rhizoplane soil was collected by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 1 min at 4 °C. Each rhizosphere or rhizoplane soil sample was re-suspended in LifeGuard soil preservation solution (Mobio Laboratories) immediately after processing. The full procedure was performed sample by sample and as quickly as possible (three persons worked together, total processing time was <5 min for each sample). The soil samples from the four corners of each tree were pooled into a single sample. The samples were stored at −20 °C until further processing. Nucleic acid extraction and sequencing DNA and RNA were extracted from 2 g of each soil sample using a RNA PowerSoil total RNA isolation kit and the RNA PowerSoil DNA Elution Accessory Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). In this extraction process, DNA and RNA were extracted from the same sample simultaneously (i.e., DNA and RNA were eluted from the same column with different elution buffer), and thus, the RNA samples reflect the real-time gene expression profiling of the corresponding DNA samples. Large-scale shotgun metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing were performed on the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform by Novogene (Novogene, Beijing, China). Briefly, the DNA samples were randomly sheared using Covaris Ultrasonic Processor into approximately 300 bp fragments, which were then used to construct the sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq® DNA PCR-free sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA). For the RNA samples, the ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero™ rRNA Removal Kit for Bacteria (Illumina, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The remaining transcripts were fragmented and reverse-transcribed. The messenger RNA (mRNA) libraries were prepared using the TrueSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina, USA), and 2 × 125-bp paired-end reads were generated for all samples. Approximately 10 Gb sequencing data for each DNA shotgun sequencing sample and 8 Gb data for each RNA sample were obtained. The DNA and RNA reads were deposited at NCBI under the bioproject accession no. PRJNA324090 and SRA accession no. SRP076109. Bioinformatics analyses The raw reads from metagenome sequencing were filtered, trimmed, and quality-controlled to generate the clean reads, which were further trimmed using Sickle [ 25 ] with the parameters –q 20 and –l 80. On average, 4.85% of the clean reads were discarded from this trimming step. The trimmed reads were aligned to the Swingle citrumelo genome [ 26 ], sweet orange genome [ 27 ], and Citrus clementina genome [ 28 ] using bowtie2 [ 29 ], and the corresponding mapped reads were removed. Only the reads that did not map to any of the three citrus genomes were retained for further analysis. The filtered reads from all 12 samples were pooled and subjected to de novo assembly using megahit v1.03 [ 30 ]. The metagenes were predicted using MetaGeneMark [ 31 ]. The non-redundant gene categories (unigenes) were generated using CD-HIT-est with an identity cutoff of 95% [ 32 ]. To obtain the taxonomic annotation for the unigenes, the protein sequences were aligned against the NCBI microbial NR database using DIAMOND software [ 33 ] with an E value cutoff of 1e-5. Then, the taxonomic annotations were assigned using the MEGAN LCA annotation method [ 34 ]. The functional annotation was assigned to the unigenes by blasting against the KEGG orthology database using DIAMOND software. To generate taxonomic and functional abundance and expression profiling, the short DNA and RNA reads from each sample were aligned to the unigenes using SOAP2 [ 35 ] with default parameters. The generated alignments were parsed, and abundance and expression profiling were obtained (reads count matrixes). Based on the abundance and expression profiles, the features (genera and KOs) with significantly differential abundance or expression activity were determined using DESeq2 with a negative binomial generalized linear model ( p < 0.05) [ 36 ]. For the rhizoplane-enriched feature detection, paired DESeq2 comparison analysis was performed separately for healthy samples and HLB samples to prevent the potential effects of health status on the results, and the identified features were merged. Other comparisons, such as healthy vs. HLB samples for differential rhizoplane taxonomic and functional feature determination, were conducted using DESeq2, where the individual samples from the healthy or HLB trees were treated as biological replicates. The taxonomic and functional dissimilarity analyses among samples were performed using the R package VEGAN [ 37 ] with a Bray-Curtis distance matrix. The variation partitioning analysis (VPA) was performed based on the taxonomic and functional composition matrix calculated on the genus and KEGG orthologue (KO) level of all 12 samples (rhizosphere and rhizoplane, healthy and HLB) using VEGAN. The heatmap and Venn diagram plots were drawn using the gplots and VennDiagram package [ 38 , 39 ], respectively. The average genome size (AGS) for the metagenomic samples was estimated using MicrobeCensus v1.0.7 based on 10 million reads [ 40 ]. The bacterial secretion system-based effector genes were identified by blasting the unigenes against a custom-built type III, IV, and VI effector library (T3SE: http://effectors.bic.nus.edu.sg/T3SEdb/index.php ; T4SE: http://sate.cirad.fr/ ; T6SE: http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/SecReT6/ ) with an amino acid identity cutoff of 45% and a coverage of 80% [ 41 ]. To explore the relative contribution of taxa to the rhizosphere to rhizoplane-enriched KOs, the taxonomic information for each selected gene (at genus and family level) was extracted, and their relationships were calculated using the method described by Ofek-Lalzar et al. [ 15 ]. The metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) extraction was performed using MetaBAT [ 42 ], and the quality of the generated MAGs was checked using CheckM [ 43 ]. The genome similarity between selected MAGs and their related genomes was determined using the GGDC2.1 server [ 44 ]. The MAGs were annotated using the RAST server and blast2GO software [ 45 , 46 ]. The annotated bin.74 and bin.105 were deposited in the RAST server with the job id 311713 and 312590, respectively. Burkholderia sp. isolation and survival assay Bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy citrus plants in a relevant study (Riera et al., Unpublished). Based on the 16S rDNA gene sequencing results using the universal primers 27F and 1492R [ 47 ], the strains were identified. Burkholderia strains were selected for the antagonistic activity test against several known citrus pathogens. Two representative Burkholderia strains, namely, Burkholderia metallica (strain A53) and Burkholderia territori (strain A63), which showed the best antagonistic activities among the tested strains, were selected for further analysis. The two strains were transformed with the pUFR034-gfp plasmid by electroporation. Positive GFP (green fluorescent protein)-labeled strains were verified by fluorescent microscopy and qPCR results. Each transformed Burkholderia strain was applied by soil drench (15 mL of 1 × 10 8 cfu/mL) to five 1-year-old potted “Valencia” sweet orange plants grown in a quarantine greenhouse facility at the Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, in Florida, USA, with controlled temperature (28–35 °C) and a relative humidity of 80%. The rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples were collected as described above (but without the LifeGuard soil preservation solution resuspension step) 1 h after inoculation (0 days post inoculation (dpi)), 2, 5, and 9 dpi. The genomic DNA was extracted using a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). The population dynamics of the inoculated strains inside the rhizosphere and rhizoplane bacterial community (calculated as relative abundance change compared to the 0 dpi data) were calculated [ 48 ], with the total bacteria population serving as the reference. A primer pair targeting the GFP gene (GFPF 5′-TCCATGCCATGTGTAATCCC-3′, GFPR 5′-CCATTACCTGTCCACACAATCT-3′) was used for the detection of the inoculated strains. qPCR assays were conducted on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using a Quantifast® SYBER® Green PCR kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions with the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C and 35 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The primer set Eub338 and Eub518, which targets the conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene, was used for the detection of total bacteria, and qPCR assays were performed as described by Fierer et al. [ 49 ]. Furthermore, the long-term survival rate of the strains was also determined using 2-year-old Duncan grapefruit plants with three plants/replicates grown under the same growth conditions described above. One gram of rhizosphere soil from each tree was collected, and colony-forming units (CFU) were calculated using nutrient agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin (strain native resistance for both strains). The CFU formation was determined at 0, 46, 60, 72, 91, 110, 131, 150, and 224 dpi. Expression of plant defense-related genes in response to beneficial bacteria treatment Fifteen milliliters of 1 × 10 8 cfu/mL of strains A53 and A63 were inoculated onto 1-year-old Valencia plants. Application of 15 mL of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) (active ingredient in Actigard 50WG)  at 0.33 mg/ml was used as a positive control. The active ingredient of Actigard is an analogue of salicylic acid and systemic elicitor of plant defense [ 50 ]. A water only inoculation was used as a negative control. For each treatment, nine seedlings were used, with each seedling as a replicate. To determine whether the treatments induced plant defense, we measured the expression of three defense-related genes: SAM, encoding S -adenosyl- l -methionine-salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase; PR1, encoding pathogenesis-related protein 1; and PR2, encoding pathogenesis-related protein 2 [ 50 ] using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The primer sequences for SAM and PR1 are SAMF 5′-GGACGCATCTTCTTGGGATAA-3′/SAMR 5′-CGTGACAGTTTCCTTGACGA-3′ and PR1F 3′-CAGGGTCTCCAAGCAACTATG-5′/PR1R 5′-CCACCTCGCGTATTTCTCTAA-3′, respectively. The primer sequences for PR2 were described previously [ 50 ]. Gene expression was determined at 0, 3, 5, and 7 dpi. For each time point, three biological repeats were sampled by collecting one leaf from three different plants. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were treated with Ambion® DNA-free DNase Treatment and Removal Reagents. The qRT-PCR was performed using a Verso 1-step RT-qPCR Kit (ThermoFisher), and the fold change was calculated using the ∆∆Ct method as previously described [ 48 ]. Results Structure and function of citrus root-associated microbiome We collected the rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples from three healthy and three HLB-diseased citrus trees for MG and MT analyses. We generated 515,129,383 paired-end clean reads, which is equal to 129 Gb for MG, and 413,225,469 paired-end clean reads, which is equal to 103 Gb for MT, for the 12 samples. The citrus host-originated MG reads were depleted by aligning the reads to the three available citrus draft genomes to comprehensively remove the host-originated reads, and 0.039 to 1.79% clean reads were removed (Additional file 1 : Table S1). We pooled the MG reads from all 12 samples in total of 501,171,627 paired-end reads (approximately 120 Gb) for de novo assembly and obtained an assembly of 10.84 Gb across 17,676,569 contigs, with the longest contig at 536,098 bp and N50 at 651 bp (based on all contigs ≥200 bp) (Additional file 1 : Table S2). In total, 22,192,564 putative protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembly. After removing redundant sequences (identity >95%), 21,380,400 unigenes were generated. The unigenes represented more rhizoplane reads (46.48 ± 4.98%, mean ± SD, same herein) than rhizosphere reads (35.44 ± 2.34%) ( p = 0.0006). Taxonomy annotation was successfully assigned to 70% of the total unigenes. Bacteria comprised the predominant domain (99.30 ± 0.37%, mean relative abundance ± SD, n = 12), with small fractions of Archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses detected based on the annotated unigenes. Proteobacteria (74.56 ± 8.59%), Actinobacteria (16.80 ± 6.95%), Bacteroidetes (2.86 ± 0.97%), and Acidobacteria (2.42 ± 0.69%) were the dominant phyla (relative abundance ≥1%) (Additional file 1 : Figure S2). Thaumarchaeota was the dominant phylum in the Archaea domain (0.41 ± 0.31%), and Ascomycota represented the most abundant phylum affiliated with fungi (0.14 ± 0.06%). Using Diamond BLASTP against the KEGG KO database, 53% of the unigenes were assigned KO function annotation, with most of the KO-annotated genes (94.3%) mapped to the KEGG pathways. In total, 8816 KOs were identified from the unigenes. KOs involved in amino acid metabolism (9.56 ± 0.06%), carbohydrate metabolism (8.65 ± 0.09%), membrane transport (8.51 ± 0.37%), and energy metabolism (5.67 ± 0.10%) were dominant (relative abundance ≥5%) based on KEGG level 2 pathway annotations. Approximately 3.05 ± 1.39% of the metatranscriptomic reads were identified as rRNA, as derived by the SortMeRNA ver. 2.1 program [ 51 ], indicating a high-efficiency rRNA depletion strategy during the MT library construction. In addition, 32.94 ± 8.36% of the RNA clean reads from the rhizoplane samples and 27.38 ± 4.91% from the rhizosphere samples could be mapped to the unigenes. On average, 24.26% (ranging from 18.01 to 41.14%) of the unigenes identified in each sample were actively expressed (Additional file 1 : Table S3). The community composition results from the MG and MT analyses revealed a similar structure when tested at the genus level (correlation coefficient r = 0.90, p < 0.005). Effects of HLB on the rhizosphere- to rhizoplane-enriched taxa The alpha diversity (Shannon index) of the rhizosphere samples was significantly increased compared to the rhizoplane samples at low (e.g., phylum) or high (e.g., genus) resolution (Additional file 1 : Table S4). The AGS of the rhizoplane microbiome was slightly but significantly increased compared to the rhizosphere microbiome (6.31 ± 0.52 Mb for rhizoplane and 5.87 ± 0.26 Mb for rhizosphere, mean ± SD, n = 6, paired t test, p = 0.01). However, no significant difference in alpha diversity or AGS due to HLB was observed for the rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples. We also performed a variation partitioning analysis to reveal the contribution of the sample layer (rhizosphere/rhizoplane) and health status (healthy/HLB) to the observed taxonomic composition difference between samples. The sample layer was the major determinant of the citrus root-associated microbiome (accounting for 78.87% of the variation observed in the entire microbial community, p = 0.024), whereas the contribution of health status was minor (9.32%, p = 0.501). The results collectively suggested that the rhizoplane microbiome harbored a distinct, less complex microbial community, in which microorganisms with larger genome size were more abundant than the rhizosphere microbiome. In addition, HLB did not significantly alter the overall structure of the root-associated microbiome (Additional file 1 : Figure S2). Owing to the intimate relationship between microbes and hosts in the rhizoplane, certain microbes are enriched from rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane, as driven by plant selection [ 5 ]. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the rhizoplane samples than the rhizosphere samples, and Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were depleted from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S3). A more detailed pairwise comparison at the genus level between the rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbial community was performed. Among the 1950 genera identified in all samples, 119 genera exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome compared to the rhizosphere microbiome. Among them, Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia whose genome sizes are 8.57 ± 0.87 Mb ( n = 8) and 7.15 ± 0.84 Mb ( n = 124) based on the available complete genomes in MBGD, respectively (accessed September 13, 2016) [ 52 ], were ranked as the top two dominant genera. The average relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia were 50.10 ± 5.22% (mean ± SD, n = 6) and 10.36 ± 4.60% for the rhizoplane samples and 36.96 ± 6.07% and 5.66 ± 3.99% for the rhizosphere samples , respectively. A positive correlation between AGS and the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium was also observed (Spearman’s rank-order correlation, rs = 0.49, p < 0.1, n = 12). No obvious correlation was observed for Burkholderia and AGS, possibly because of its relative low abundance in the samples. Given the large genome size and significantly increased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome compared to the rhizosphere microbiome, we reasoned that Bradyrhizobium was the main contributor of the increased AGS observed in the rhizoplane microbiome. Fifty-two of the 119 rhizoplane-enriched genera exhibited significantly different relative abundance between healthy and HLB rhizoplane samples. Notably, 50 of these 52 genera were more abundant in healthy rhizoplane samples than HLB samples (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1 : Figure S4), and the other two genera, Inquilinus and Aureimonas , contain known human pathogens [ 53 , 54 ] and exhibited increased relative abundance in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples. Among these 50 genera, Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia [ 55 , 56 ] together with several other known root-associated microorganisms such as Variovorax [ 57 ], Bdellovibrio [ 58 ], Chryseobacterium [ 59 , 60 ], Dyadobacter [ 61 ], and Penicillium from the fungi kingdom [ 62 ] were observed. Cellvibrio , which is rhizoplane-enriched and has plant growth-promoting capacity [ 15 , 63 ], exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in healthy rhizoplane samples compared in HLB samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S5A). A nearly complete genome (genome size 5.7 Mb, completeness 99.14% and contamination 0.23% by checkM [ 43 ], composing of 41 contigs) representing a novel species of Cellvibrio (Additional file 1 : Table S5) was generated using the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) extraction approach [ 42 ]. Plant cell wall polysaccharide-degrading enzymes are key features in rhizoplane microbiome [ 15 ]. In total, 350 of 4794 genes in the assembled Cellvibrio bin were involved in carbohydrate utilization as suggested by dbCAN [ 64 ], which was significantly increased compared to the non-plant-associated relatives, such as Escherichia coli K12 (132 of 4372 genes are identified, Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001). Multiple plant growth-promoting-associated genes, such as genes involved in IAA synthesis, were present and actively expressed (Additional file 1 : Figure S5B). Fig. 1 Top rhizoplane-enriched genera with different relative abundances between healthy and HLB rhizoplane samples ( displayed by pie chart ). The average relative abundance of each taxon in the rhizoplane samples is displayed as a percentage. HLB.P ( blue ): rhizoplane samples from HLB trees; H.P ( red ): rhizoplane samples from healthy trees. The genome size for each genus was calculated as the average genome size based on the available complete genomes from MBGD. The full list is shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S4 Ninety-four rhizoplane-depleted genera were identified, which were mainly affiliated with Actinobacteria , Acidobacteria , and Archaea, including Thaumarchaeota . The majority of rhizoplane-depleted taxa with significantly different relative abundance between healthy and HLB samples (36 of 39 genera) exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome compared to healthy samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S6). Thaumarchaea represents an autotrophic microorganism in the soil microbial community [ 65 ]. The relative abundance of Thaumarchaea significantly decreased from the rhizosphere to the rhizoplane ( p < 0.05) and exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome of HLB plants compared to healthy trees (Additional file 1 : Figure S7A). One high-quality Thaumarchaeota MAG was extracted from the metagenome assembly (3.17 Mb, completeness 93.2%, and contamination rate 0.97%). The amoA gene-based phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the Thaumarchaeota MAG (bin.105) was affiliated with the Thaumarchaeota group I.1b (Additional file 1 : Figure S7B). The low similarity between bin.105 and the other three available Thaumarchaeota group I.1b genomes demonstrated that bin.105 represents a novel member of the Thaumarchaeota phylum (Additional file 1 : Table S6). Multiple genes involved in the autotrophic life cycle, including nitrification-associated genes (including amoA and amoB , urease-encoding genes ure ABCEFGD) and carbon fixation-associated genes (including 4-hydroxybutyrate-CoA dehydratase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and methylmalonyl-CoA), are present in bin.105. Effects of HLB on rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane-enriched functional properties Both the KO presence/absence and relative abundance profiling demonstrated that all samples shared very similar functional attributes (Fig. 2a, b ). In total, 89.7% of the identified KOs (7938 of 8816) were found in all samples, and the composition similarity among these samples was greater than 98.7%, suggesting that the functional composition of the citrus root-associated microbiome was more conserved than the taxonomic composition ( p < 2.2E−16) (Fig. 2a, b and Additional file 1 : Figure S2). The sample layer contributed significantly to the functional composition variation (80.84%, p = 0.036) with a minute contribution from health status (9.57%, p = 0.497). We performed the layer KO enrichment analysis to identify the rhizoplane-enriched functional properties. We then determined how HLB affected these rhizoplane-enriched properties at both the genetic potential and gene expression levels. In total, 2218 rhizoplane-enriched KOs were identified. The KOs belonging to the transporter, two-component system, ABC transporter, secretion system, transcription factors, and bacterial motility proteins were the top six enriched functional attributes, highlighting the importance of these functions for microorganisms to adapt to the plant-root surface niche. All identified rhizoplane-enriched KOs were actively expressed, as revealed by the metatranscriptomic data (Additional file 2 ).

Dark gray : rhizoplane-enriched function; light blue : rhizoplane-depleted; genes in green : increased relative abundance at the DNA level; genes in purple : increased expression level; genes in red : increased abundance and expression level. HLB.P ( blue ): rhizoplane samples from HLB trees; H.P ( red ): rhizoplane samples from healthy trees; HLB.S ( green ): rhizosphere samples from HLB trees; H.S ( yellow ): rhizosphere samples from healthy trees QseC , an important quorum-sensing gene controlling bacterial flagella and motility [ 66 ], was rhizoplane-enriched and exhibited significantly increased abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to the HLB samples. A similar pattern was observed for multiple root surface niche adaption-associated genes, such as bacterial chemotaxis sensor-related genes (including aer (aerotaxis (oxygen-sensing) receptor), tsr (serine receptor), tar (aspartate/maltose receptor), and trg (ribose and galactose chemoreceptor)); flagellar assembly-associated genes (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S8); the surface contact signal sensing and biofilm formation regulation-associated genes wspABCDR [ 67 ]; and the chemosensory complex genes involved in pilus synthesis, including pilILJ , pilus assembly genes (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S9), and LPS synthesis and transporter genes (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S10). Multiple genes belonging to the secretion systems, including T1SS ( hlyBD and raxAB ), T2SS ( gspCFHIJLM ), T3SS ( yscCJRSTUVNQ ), T4aSS ( virD4 and virB1-11 except virB7 ), and T4bSS ( icmQ ) and T6SS ( ppkA , clpV , impKL , vasD and hcp , and its secreted substrate vgrG ), were enriched on the rhizoplane. The majority of the identified secretion genes exhibited significantly increased relative abundance and expression activity in healthy rhizoplane samples compared to their HLB counterparts (Figs. 2c and 3 ). Concomitantly, effector genes, including xopAS , nolX , and hpa2 , and several Rhs element vgr family genes exhibited significantly increased relative abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to HLB samples (Fig. 2c ). Fig. 3 The relative abundance and expression profiling of rhizoplane-enriched genes involved in bacterial secretion systems.

Red denotes “higher in healthy samples,” while blue denotes “higher in HLB samples.” The asterisk denotes P < 0.01; the plus sign denotes P < 0.05. MG , metagenome data, MT metatranscriptome data, P rhizoplane, S rhizosphere The yesM-yesN two-component system, which is involved in carbohydrate utilization for bacteria [ 68 ], was enriched from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane microbiome. Several transporter-encoding genes whose products are responsible for importing plant-derived polysaccharide sources to bacterial cells including togBMNA (pectin-associated), fucP (fucose-associated), dgoT ( d -galactonate-associated), araJ (arabinose-associated), nagE ( N -acetylglucosamine-associated), lacE (lactose-associated), and dctS (C4-dicarboxylate sensor kinase) were enriched in the rhizoplane microbiome. Furthermore, the relative abundance of all these genes (expect togM ) was increased in healthy rhizoplane samples. Significantly, increased expression was observed for togBNA and dctS in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to HLB samples. Consistent with this observation, genes involved in “starch and sucrose metabolism” were enriched in the rhizoplane and exhibited increased abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to HLB samples (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S11). In contrast, genes involved in “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes,” which were depleted in the rhizoplane microbiome, exhibited increased relative abundance and expression activity in HLB rhizoplane samples (Figs. 2c and 4 ). Increased relative abundance was observed for nitrification-associated key genes (identified as rhizosphere- to rhizoplane-depleted), including amoA , amoB , amoC , and hao (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase), in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples. The urease-encoding genes ureA , ureB , and ureC involved in degrading urea to ammonia, which contributes to both nitrification and carbon fixation, and the transporter genes for the coenzyme nickel metal for the urease [ 69 ], nikA and nikB , also exhibited significantly increased expression levels in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S12).

MG metagenome data, MT metatranscriptome data, P rhizoplane, S rhizosphere Linking the rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties To visualize the association between rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties, we determined the taxonomic origin of rhizoplane-enriched functional attributes for all samples. The rhizoplane-enriched KOs were clustered at KEGG pathway level 3, and the clustered categories involved in host-microbe interactions identified in the above section, including the bacterial secretion system (BSS), flagellar assembly (FA), pilus assembly (PA), bacterial chemotaxis (BCh), and LPS synthesis (LPS), were analyzed, as were the rhizoplane-enriched KOs involved in starch and sucrose metabolism (SSM). Proteobacteria were the main contributor of these functions and contributed significantly more to the rhizoplane samples (95.3 ± 0.15% of the normalized total relative contribution for the six functional categories) than the rhizosphere samples (86.6 ± 1.27%) (paired t test, p < 0.01). A reduced contribution by taxa belonging to Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria was also observed (two taxa together accounting for 2.98 ± 0.14% of the normalized total relative contribution for the rhizoplane samples and 9.59 ± 1.43% for the rhizosphere samples, paired t test, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5 ). The relative contribution of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia to the six functional categories for the rhizoplane samples ranged from 6.2 to 38.1% and 2.9 to 19.2%, respectively, and their relative contribution to the rhizoplane samples significantly increased compared to the rhizosphere samples ( p < 0.05 for Bradyrhizobium and p = 3.4E−5 for Burkholderia , respectively). The genes involved in the type IVb secretion system identified from our samples were mostly from unclassified bacteria (Additional file 1 : Figure S13). Fig. 5 Relative contribution of different taxa (family or genus levels) to identified rhizoplane-enriched functional attributes in different samples. BSS bacterial secretion system, FA flagellar assembly, PA pilus assembly, BCh bacteria chemotaxis, LPS lipopolysaccharide assembly, SSM starch and sucrose metabolism Expression activity comparison of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia between rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia were the top two dominant and rhizoplane-enriched genera. To reveal the mechanisms underlying their highly efficient colonization, particularly in the rhizoplane, we extracted all genes originating from the two genera from the KO-annotated genes. In all, 2228 Bradyrhizobium and 2603 Burkholderia KOs were identified. These identified KOs exhibited overall higher relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome than the rhizosphere microbiome on a functional potential level (Additional file 1 : Figure S14), further demonstrating rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment for both genera. The differentially expressed (DE) KOs between the rhizoplane and rhizosphere samples for the two genera were further determined using metatranscriptomic data . In total, 287 and 185 DE KOs were identified for Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia , respectively, including 163 rhizoplane-upregulated and 124 rhizoplane-downregulated KOs for Bradyrhizobium and 89 rhizoplane-upregulated and 96 rhizoplane-downregulated KOs for Burkholderia . The majority of these rhizoplane-upregulated KOs (153 of 163 for Bradyrhizobium and 83 of 89 for Burkholderia ) were not identified when comparing the rhizoplane and rhizosphere samples at the whole community level using metatranscriptomic data. Overrepresentation of multiple KEGG pathways involved in metabolism was observed for the rhizoplane-downregulated KOs for Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia , and consistent enrichment of the categories “energy metabolism” and “carbohydrate metabolism” for both genera was also observed ( p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, two-tail). The Bradyrhizobium rhizoplane-upregulated KOs were enriched in the categories of “transcription” and “metabolism|unclassified,” and the Burkholderia rhizoplane-upregulated KOs were enriched in the categories of “signal transduction” and “cell motility” (Table 1 ). All Burkholderia rhizoplane-upregulated KOs involved in “cell motility” were responsible for flagellar and pilus assembly; the KO representing the flagellar transcriptional activator flhD was found in the “signal transduction” category. Several other efflux system-associated genes, such as mdtA and mdtC , were also present in the Burkholderia “signal transduction” category. The majority of the Bradyrhizobium rhizoplane-upregulated KOs belonging to “metabolism|unclassified” were associated with cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, the gene encoding salicylate hydroxylase which converts salicylic acid, a critical phytohormone for plant systemic acquired resistance, to nonfunctional compound catechol was expressed at a significantly increased level in the rhizoplane compared to the rhizosphere for Bradyrhizobium .

The significant p values were italicized, and the underrepresented items were bolded Effects of inoculated Burkholderia strains on plant fitness Members of Burkholderia have been known to benefit plants. Because Burkholderia are enriched from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane and it is one of the most abundant bacteria associated with citrus roots, we determined the contribution of Burkholderia to the citrus hosts. We isolated multiple Burkholderia strains from the rhizosphere of healthy citrus plants in a relevant study (Riera et al., unpublished data). We selected two representative strains A53 ( Burkholderia metallica ) and A63 ( Burkholderia territori ), which showed the best antagonistic activities against Sinorhizobium meliloti , a relative of the HLB causal agent Las, and several other citrus pathogens, such as Phytophthora spp. and Alternaria alternate (Riera et al., unpublished data), to inoculate citrus plants using the soil drench method. The results demonstrated that the two strains successfully colonized the root surface and maintained significantly higher relative abundance inside the rhizoplane bacterial community than inside the rhizosphere bacterial community (Student’s t test, p < 0.05 for both strains when detected at 5 and 9 dpi) (Additional file 1 : Figure S15), demonstrating that the two strains were more adapted to the rhizoplane niche than that to the rhizosphere. The inoculated strains survived well, even 7 months after inoculation (Figs. 6a, b ). We then conducted a greenhouse study to evaluate the effects of the selected strains on plant fitness. Salicylic acid (SA)-mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) is an important benefit of beneficial bacteria to the plant host [ 70 ]. We determined the expression of three SA-mediated ISR marker genes, SAM, PR1, and PR2, for the inoculated trees. Plants treated with strain A53 exhibited a significant upregulation of PR2 gene at 3 dpi compared to negative control plants. A63 induced expression of the SAM gene at 5 dpi and the PR1 gene at 7 dpi. Similarly, Actigard, an analogue of SA, induced PR1 and SAM gene expression at 5 and 7 dpi (Fig. 6c ). Fig. 6 Survival rates of Burkholderia spp. inoculation and effects on expression of the citrus ISR-associated genes. Colony-forming units were represented in log10 scale for a strain A53 and b strain A63. Colonies were counted in NA plates supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) since both strains are kanamycin-resistant.

Each biological replicate contains three technical repeats Discussion Our data demonstrated reduced genetic and microbial complexity in the citrus rhizoplane microbiome compared to that in the rhizosphere communities, indicating the filter effect of plant hosts on the closely associated rhizoplane microbiome assembly [ 5 ]. This finding is consistent with previous findings based on annual plants [ 13 , 17 ], indicating that the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment of microbiome occurs in both annual and perennial plants. Our data further suggested that the niche enrichment process is fine-tuned by the plant host for the desired functions, resulting in dramatic structural changes of the microbiome (Fig. 5 ). Bacteria were the most dominant domain and accounted for more than 99% of the citrus root-associated microbiome, whereas minimal Archaea and fungi were found. The taxonomic composition of the citrus root-associated microbiome identified here was very similar with that of wheat and cucumber, where the relative abundance of bacteria is more than 99% [ 15 ]. Proteobacteria , which was dominated by Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia (Fig. 1 ), was enriched on the rhizoplane, and depletion of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria was observed in this process. We demonstrated that the genes involved in utilizing the root-derived carbon source were enriched from the rhizosphere to the rhizoplane, further suggesting the importance of plant cell wall polysaccharide utilization-associated genes for the rhizoplane microbiome. These genes were gradually enriched from the free living bulk soil inoculum, the rhizosphere to the rhizoplane [ 15 ]. However, the genes involved in “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes,” which are critical for autotrophic microorganisms, were depleted in rhizoplane samples, collectively highlighting that the plant-derived carbon sources are an important driving force for citrus rhizoplane microbiome assembly. This finding is consistent with the notion that the microbiome on the rhizoplane enjoys superior access to plant exudates compared to the microbiome in the rhizosphere. Functional features, such as motility, chemotaxis, two-component system and secretion systems, LPS, and type IV pilus synthesis, were rhizoplane-enriched, indicating more active plant-microbe interactions on the rhizoplane than on the rhizosphere. We envision that following chemotaxis sensing, the active motility mediated mainly by flagella and pili allows the microbes to rapidly reach the preferred root surface niches to form biofilms or aggregates with the help of adhesions such as LPS and pili. Interestingly, several secreted effectors were actively expressed in the rhizoplane microbiome that may benefit the microbiome by modulating the plant immune system. Rhizoplane enrichment of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia was observed in this study. Similar enrichment patterns were also observed when analyzing samples collected from 27 important citrus-growing areas worldwide, suggesting the ubiquity and importance of these two genera for the citrus root-associated microbiome (Zhang and Wang, unpublished data). The enrichment of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia on the rhizoplane indicated their successful strategy for rhizoplane adaption. The metatranscriptomic data demonstrated that the functions involved in metabolic activities were more actively expressed in the rhizosphere than the rhizoplane for both genera, further suggesting that nutrient resources were more easily accessed for the rhizoplane microbiome than the rhizosphere microbiome. In addition to common rhizoplane-enriched genes, multiple Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia specific genes, such as efflux system-associated genes, cell motility-associated genes, and plant defense-resistant-associated genes, were more active on the rhizoplane than the rhizosphere for Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia but were not identified for the remaining microorganisms. The efflux system-associated genes contribute to successful interactions with host plants [ 71 ]. The salicylic acid-degrading enzyme salicylate hydroxylase encoding gene from Bradyrhizobium exhibited significantly increased expression activity on the rhizoplane and might contribute to the colonization of Bradyrhizobium by suppressing the plant defense response [ 72 ]. The relative abundance of the rhizoplane-enriched taxa and functional properties, as well as the expression profiling of the rhizoplane-enriched functional features were significantly reduced by HLB. Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia , the two most dominant rhizoplane-enriched genera, exhibited reduced relative abundance in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples. Our previous cultivation-based results demonstrated that the Burkholderia population was significantly increased in the healthy citrus endorhiza microbiome compared to HLB samples, whereas Bradyrhizobium was not observed, mainly because of their slow growth (~2 weeks for colony formation. This is longer than the experiment design, during which colonies were harvested after 3–10 days of incubation) [ 22 ]. These results suggested that the citrus plants prefer Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia and enrich them from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane. The survival rate assay of the two inoculated Burkholderia strains further demonstrated that the Burkholderia strains were more adapted to the rhizoplane niche than the rhizosphere. Root-associated Bradyrhizobium is frequently reported as plant-beneficial bacteria [ 55 , 73 ]; beneficial effects of Burkholderia also are frequently observed [ 22 , 56 , 74 ]. Furthermore, when the citrus were inoculated with Burkholderia strains isolated from the healthy citrus root-associated microbiome, several ISR-associated genes in the citrus trees were induced (Fig. 6 ) that might reduce HLB disease progress. Multiple beneficial bacteria stimulate plant immunity in an SA-dependent ISR manner [ 70 ]. The observed upregulation of ISR-associated genes, especially the upregulation of SAM by Burkholderia sp. inoculation, likely promotes plant health by triggering SA-dependent broad-spectrum systemic resistance to pathogens, which might be an important aspect of plant-beneficial microbe interactions. Other rhizoplane-enriched taxa, such as Variovorax and Bdellovibrio , exhibited decreased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome when trees became infected with Las (Fig. 1 ). Variovorax and Bdellovibrio exhibit plant growth promotion effects [ 57 , 58 ]. Additionally, our results revealed rhizoplane-enriched functional properties, including chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, LPS synthesis and transport, as well as secretion system and related effectors, were depleted by HLB. However, the rhizoplane-depleted functional features, including “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes” and nitrification and denitrification-related genes, exhibited significantly increased relative abundance and expression levels in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome compared to those in the healthy samples (Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 and Additional file 1 : Figures S8–S13). Reduced relative abundance and activity of plant-derived polysaccharide utilization-associated genes together with the increased relative abundance and activity of autotrophic life cycle-adapted carbon fixation, nitrification, and denitrification functional features, support our notion that HLB trees supplied less easy-to-use carbon source, e.g., sucrose for root-associated microbiome use [ 24 ]. These data are consistent with the notion that HLB affects the availability of sucrose to microbes on the rhizoplane because of its effect on phloem transportation of photoassimilates [ 18 ] and root decline [ 20 ]. In particular, HLB affects functional features, such as motility, chemotaxis, two-component system and secretion systems, as well as LPS and type IV pilus synthesis with significantly increased relative abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared in HLB samples (Fig. 2 ). These findings clearly demonstrated the negative effect on the microbiome at the community level. The negative effects of HLB on the citrus microbiome will ultimately deteriorate the beneficial interactions between the microbiome and the host. Conclusions Overall, we demonstrate that the functional properties involved in host-microbe interactions are critical for the microbiome-inhabiting plant root surfaces and are influenced dramatically by the availability of plant exudates. These rhizoplane-enriched functional properties can subsequently benefit the plant host. HLB not only alters the physiology of the citrus host but also impairs the microbiome-host interaction. Our study provides novel insights for understanding the composition and function of the plant rhizoplane-enriched microbiome and its effect on plant health.
MATERIALS
. Samples were treated with Ambion® DNA-free DNase Treatment and Removal Reagents. The qRT-PCR was performed using a Verso 1-step RT-qPCR Kit (ThermoFisher), and the fold change was calculated using the ∆∆Ct method as previously described [ 48 ]. Results Structure and function of citrus root-associated microbiome We collected the rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples from three healthy and three HLB-diseased citrus trees for MG and MT analyses. We generated 515,129,383 paired-end clean reads, which is equal to 129 Gb for MG, and 413,225,469 paired-end clean reads, which is equal to 103 Gb for MT, for the 12 samples. The citrus host-originated MG reads were depleted by aligning the reads to the three available citrus draft genomes to comprehensively remove the host-originated reads, and 0.039 to 1.79% clean reads were removed (Additional file 1 : Table S1). We pooled the MG reads from all 12 samples in total of 501,171,627 paired-end reads (approximately 120 Gb) for de novo assembly and obtained an assembly of 10.84 Gb across 17,676,569 contigs, with the longest contig at 536,098 bp and N50 at 651 bp (based on all contigs ≥200 bp) (Additional file 1 : Table S2). In total, 22,192,564 putative protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembly. After removing redundant sequences (identity >95%), 21,380,400 unigenes were generated. The unigenes represented more rhizoplane reads (46.48 ± 4.98%, mean ± SD, same herein) than rhizosphere reads (35.44 ± 2.34%) ( p = 0.0006). Taxonomy annotation was successfully assigned to 70% of the total unigenes. Bacteria comprised the predominant domain (99.30 ± 0.37%, mean relative abundance ± SD, n = 12), with small fractions of Archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses detected based on the annotated unigenes. Proteobacteria (74.56 ± 8.59%), Actinobacteria (16.80 ± 6.95%), Bacteroidetes (2.86 ± 0.97%), and Acidobacteria (2.42 ± 0.69%) were the dominant phyla (relative abundance ≥1%) (Additional file 1 : Figure S2). Thaumarchaeota was the dominant phylum in the Archaea domain (0.41 ± 0.31%), and Ascomycota represented the most abundant phylum affiliated with fungi (0.14 ± 0.06%). Using Diamond BLASTP against the KEGG KO database, 53% of the unigenes were assigned KO function annotation, with most of the KO-annotated genes (94.3%) mapped to the KEGG pathways. In total, 8816 KOs were identified from the unigenes. KOs involved in amino acid metabolism (9.56 ± 0.06%), carbohydrate metabolism (8.65 ± 0.09%), membrane transport (8.51 ± 0.37%), and energy metabolism (5.67 ± 0.10%) were dominant (relative abundance ≥5%) based on KEGG level 2 pathway annotations. Approximately 3.05 ± 1.39% of the metatranscriptomic reads were identified as rRNA, as derived by the SortMeRNA ver. 2.1 program [ 51 ], indicating a high-efficiency rRNA depletion strategy during the MT library construction. In addition, 32.94 ± 8.36% of the RNA clean reads from the rhizoplane samples and 27.38 ± 4.91% from the rhizosphere samples could be mapped to the unigenes. On average, 24.26% (ranging from 18.01 to 41.14%) of the unigenes identified in each sample were actively expressed (Additional file 1 : Table S3). The community composition results from the MG and MT analyses revealed a similar structure when tested at the genus level (correlation coefficient r = 0.90, p < 0.005). Effects of HLB on the rhizosphere- to rhizoplane-enriched taxa The alpha diversity (Shannon index) of the rhizosphere samples was significantly increased compared to the rhizoplane samples at low (e.g., phylum) or high (e.g., genus) resolution (Additional file 1 : Table S4). The AGS of the rhizoplane microbiome was slightly but significantly increased compared to the rhizosphere microbiome (6.31 ± 0.52 Mb for rhizoplane and 5.87 ± 0.26 Mb for rhizosphere, mean ± SD, n = 6, paired t test, p = 0.01). However, no significant difference in alpha diversity or AGS due to HLB was observed for the rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples. We also performed a variation partitioning analysis to reveal the contribution of the sample layer (rhizosphere/rhizoplane) and health status (healthy/HLB) to the observed taxonomic composition difference between samples. The sample layer was the major determinant of the citrus root-associated microbiome (accounting for 78.87% of the variation observed in the entire microbial community, p = 0.024), whereas the contribution of health status was minor (9.32%, p = 0.501). The results collectively suggested that the rhizoplane microbiome harbored a distinct, less complex microbial community, in which microorganisms with larger genome size were more abundant than the rhizosphere microbiome. In addition, HLB did not significantly alter the overall structure of the root-associated microbiome (Additional file 1 : Figure S2). Owing to the intimate relationship between microbes and hosts in the rhizoplane, certain microbes are enriched from rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane, as driven by plant selection [ 5 ]. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the rhizoplane samples than the rhizosphere samples, and Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were depleted from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S3). A more detailed pairwise comparison at the genus level between the rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbial community was performed. Among the 1950 genera identified in all samples, 119 genera exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome compared to the rhizosphere microbiome. Among them, Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia whose genome sizes are 8.57 ± 0.87 Mb ( n = 8) and 7.15 ± 0.84 Mb ( n = 124) based on the available complete genomes in MBGD, respectively (accessed September 13, 2016) [ 52 ], were ranked as the top two dominant genera. The average relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia were 50.10 ± 5.22% (mean ± SD, n = 6) and 10.36 ± 4.60% for the rhizoplane samples and 36.96 ± 6.07% and 5.66 ± 3.99% for the rhizosphere samples , respectively. A positive correlation between AGS and the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium was also observed (Spearman’s rank-order correlation, rs = 0.49, p < 0.1, n = 12). No obvious correlation was observed for Burkholderia and AGS, possibly because of its relative low abundance in the samples. Given the large genome size and significantly increased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome compared to the rhizosphere microbiome, we reasoned that Bradyrhizobium was the main contributor of the increased AGS observed in the rhizoplane microbiome. Fifty-two of the 119 rhizoplane-enriched genera exhibited significantly different relative abundance between healthy and HLB rhizoplane samples. Notably, 50 of these 52 genera were more abundant in healthy rhizoplane samples than HLB samples (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1 : Figure S4), and the other two genera, Inquilinus and Aureimonas , contain known human pathogens [ 53 , 54 ] and exhibited increased relative abundance in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples. Among these 50 genera, Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia [ 55 , 56 ] together with several other known root-associated microorganisms such as Variovorax [ 57 ], Bdellovibrio [ 58 ], Chryseobacterium [ 59 , 60 ], Dyadobacter [ 61 ], and Penicillium from the fungi kingdom [ 62 ] were observed. Cellvibrio , which is rhizoplane-enriched and has plant growth-promoting capacity [ 15 , 63 ], exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in healthy rhizoplane samples compared in HLB samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S5A). A nearly complete genome (genome size 5.7 Mb, completeness 99.14% and contamination 0.23% by checkM [ 43 ], composing of 41 contigs) representing a novel species of Cellvibrio (Additional file 1 : Table S5) was generated using the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) extraction approach [ 42 ]. Plant cell wall polysaccharide-degrading enzymes are key features in rhizoplane microbiome [ 15 ]. In total, 350 of 4794 genes in the assembled Cellvibrio bin were involved in carbohydrate utilization as suggested by dbCAN [ 64 ], which was significantly increased compared to the non-plant-associated relatives, such as Escherichia coli K12 (132 of 4372 genes are identified, Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001). Multiple plant growth-promoting-associated genes, such as genes involved in IAA synthesis, were present and actively expressed (Additional file 1 : Figure S5B). Fig. 1 Top rhizoplane-enriched genera with different relative abundances between healthy and HLB rhizoplane samples ( displayed by pie chart ). The average relative abundance of each taxon in the rhizoplane samples is displayed as a percentage. HLB.P ( blue ): rhizoplane samples from HLB trees; H.P ( red ): rhizoplane samples from healthy trees. The genome size for each genus was calculated as the average genome size based on the available complete genomes from MBGD. The full list is shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S4 Ninety-four rhizoplane-depleted genera were identified, which were mainly affiliated with Actinobacteria , Acidobacteria , and Archaea, including Thaumarchaeota . The majority of rhizoplane-depleted taxa with significantly different relative abundance between healthy and HLB samples (36 of 39 genera) exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome compared to healthy samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S6). Thaumarchaea represents an autotrophic microorganism in the soil microbial community [ 65 ]. The relative abundance of Thaumarchaea significantly decreased from the rhizosphere to the rhizoplane ( p < 0.05) and exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome of HLB plants compared to healthy trees (Additional file 1 : Figure S7A). One high-quality Thaumarchaeota MAG was extracted from the metagenome assembly (3.17 Mb, completeness 93.2%, and contamination rate 0.97%). The amoA gene-based phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the Thaumarchaeota MAG (bin.105) was affiliated with the Thaumarchaeota group I.1b (Additional file 1 : Figure S7B). The low similarity between bin.105 and the other three available Thaumarchaeota group I.1b genomes demonstrated that bin.105 represents a novel member of the Thaumarchaeota phylum (Additional file 1 : Table S6). Multiple genes involved in the autotrophic life cycle, including nitrification-associated genes (including amoA and amoB , urease-encoding genes ure ABCEFGD) and carbon fixation-associated genes (including 4-hydroxybutyrate-CoA dehydratase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and methylmalonyl-CoA), are present in bin.105. Effects of HLB on rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane-enriched functional properties Both the KO presence/absence and relative abundance profiling demonstrated that all samples shared very similar functional attributes (Fig. 2a, b ). In total, 89.7% of the identified KOs (7938 of 8816) were found in all samples, and the composition similarity among these samples was greater than 98.7%, suggesting that the functional composition of the citrus root-associated microbiome was more conserved than the taxonomic composition ( p < 2.2E−16) (Fig. 2a, b and Additional file 1 : Figure S2). The sample layer contributed significantly to the functional composition variation (80.84%, p = 0.036) with a minute contribution from health status (9.57%, p = 0.497). We performed the layer KO enrichment analysis to identify the rhizoplane-enriched functional properties. We then determined how HLB affected these rhizoplane-enriched properties at both the genetic potential and gene expression levels. In total, 2218 rhizoplane-enriched KOs were identified. The KOs belonging to the transporter, two-component system, ABC transporter, secretion system, transcription factors, and bacterial motility proteins were the top six enriched functional attributes, highlighting the importance of these functions for microorganisms to adapt to the plant-root surface niche. All identified rhizoplane-enriched KOs were actively expressed, as revealed by the metatranscriptomic data (Additional file 2 ).

Dark gray : rhizoplane-enriched function; light blue : rhizoplane-depleted; genes in green : increased relative abundance at the DNA level; genes in purple : increased expression level; genes in red : increased abundance and expression level. HLB.P ( blue ): rhizoplane samples from HLB trees; H.P ( red ): rhizoplane samples from healthy trees; HLB.S ( green ): rhizosphere samples from HLB trees; H.S ( yellow ): rhizosphere samples from healthy trees QseC , an important quorum-sensing gene controlling bacterial flagella and motility [ 66 ], was rhizoplane-enriched and exhibited significantly increased abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to the HLB samples. A similar pattern was observed for multiple root surface niche adaption-associated genes, such as bacterial chemotaxis sensor-related genes (including aer (aerotaxis (oxygen-sensing) receptor), tsr (serine receptor), tar (aspartate/maltose receptor), and trg (ribose and galactose chemoreceptor)); flagellar assembly-associated genes (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S8); the surface contact signal sensing and biofilm formation regulation-associated genes wspABCDR [ 67 ]; and the chemosensory complex genes involved in pilus synthesis, including pilILJ , pilus assembly genes (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S9), and LPS synthesis and transporter genes (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S10). Multiple genes belonging to the secretion systems, including T1SS ( hlyBD and raxAB ), T2SS ( gspCFHIJLM ), T3SS ( yscCJRSTUVNQ ), T4aSS ( virD4 and virB1-11 except virB7 ), and T4bSS ( icmQ ) and T6SS ( ppkA , clpV , impKL , vasD and hcp , and its secreted substrate vgrG ), were enriched on the rhizoplane. The majority of the identified secretion genes exhibited significantly increased relative abundance and expression activity in healthy rhizoplane samples compared to their HLB counterparts (Figs. 2c and 3 ). Concomitantly, effector genes, including xopAS , nolX , and hpa2 , and several Rhs element vgr family genes exhibited significantly increased relative abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to HLB samples (Fig. 2c ). Fig. 3 The relative abundance and expression profiling of rhizoplane-enriched genes involved in bacterial secretion systems.

Red denotes “higher in healthy samples,” while blue denotes “higher in HLB samples.” The asterisk denotes P < 0.01; the plus sign denotes P < 0.05. MG , metagenome data, MT metatranscriptome data, P rhizoplane, S rhizosphere The yesM-yesN two-component system, which is involved in carbohydrate utilization for bacteria [ 68 ], was enriched from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane microbiome. Several transporter-encoding genes whose products are responsible for importing plant-derived polysaccharide sources to bacterial cells including togBMNA (pectin-associated), fucP (fucose-associated), dgoT ( d -galactonate-associated), araJ (arabinose-associated), nagE ( N -acetylglucosamine-associated), lacE (lactose-associated), and dctS (C4-dicarboxylate sensor kinase) were enriched in the rhizoplane microbiome. Furthermore, the relative abundance of all these genes (expect togM ) was increased in healthy rhizoplane samples. Significantly, increased expression was observed for togBNA and dctS in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to HLB samples. Consistent with this observation, genes involved in “starch and sucrose metabolism” were enriched in the rhizoplane and exhibited increased abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared to HLB samples (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S11). In contrast, genes involved in “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes,” which were depleted in the rhizoplane microbiome, exhibited increased relative abundance and expression activity in HLB rhizoplane samples (Figs. 2c and 4 ). Increased relative abundance was observed for nitrification-associated key genes (identified as rhizosphere- to rhizoplane-depleted), including amoA , amoB , amoC , and hao (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase), in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples. The urease-encoding genes ureA , ureB , and ureC involved in degrading urea to ammonia, which contributes to both nitrification and carbon fixation, and the transporter genes for the coenzyme nickel metal for the urease [ 69 ], nikA and nikB , also exhibited significantly increased expression levels in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1 : Figure S12).

MG metagenome data, MT metatranscriptome data, P rhizoplane, S rhizosphere Linking the rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties To visualize the association between rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties, we determined the taxonomic origin of rhizoplane-enriched functional attributes for all samples. The rhizoplane-enriched KOs were clustered at KEGG pathway level 3, and the clustered categories involved in host-microbe interactions identified in the above section, including the bacterial secretion system (BSS), flagellar assembly (FA), pilus assembly (PA), bacterial chemotaxis (BCh), and LPS synthesis (LPS), were analyzed, as were the rhizoplane-enriched KOs involved in starch and sucrose metabolism (SSM). Proteobacteria were the main contributor of these functions and contributed significantly more to the rhizoplane samples (95.3 ± 0.15% of the normalized total relative contribution for the six functional categories) than the rhizosphere samples (86.6 ± 1.27%) (paired t test, p < 0.01). A reduced contribution by taxa belonging to Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria was also observed (two taxa together accounting for 2.98 ± 0.14% of the normalized total relative contribution for the rhizoplane samples and 9.59 ± 1.43% for the rhizosphere samples, paired t test, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5 ). The relative contribution of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia to the six functional categories for the rhizoplane samples ranged from 6.2 to 38.1% and 2.9 to 19.2%, respectively, and their relative contribution to the rhizoplane samples significantly increased compared to the rhizosphere samples ( p < 0.05 for Bradyrhizobium and p = 3.4E−5 for Burkholderia , respectively). The genes involved in the type IVb secretion system identified from our samples were mostly from unclassified bacteria (Additional file 1 : Figure S13). Fig. 5 Relative contribution of different taxa (family or genus levels) to identified rhizoplane-enriched functional attributes in different samples. BSS bacterial secretion system, FA flagellar assembly, PA pilus assembly, BCh bacteria chemotaxis, LPS lipopolysaccharide assembly, SSM starch and sucrose metabolism Expression activity comparison of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia between rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia were the top two dominant and rhizoplane-enriched genera. To reveal the mechanisms underlying their highly efficient colonization, particularly in the rhizoplane, we extracted all genes originating from the two genera from the KO-annotated genes. In all, 2228 Bradyrhizobium and 2603 Burkholderia KOs were identified. These identified KOs exhibited overall higher relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome than the rhizosphere microbiome on a functional potential level (Additional file 1 : Figure S14), further demonstrating rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment for both genera. The differentially expressed (DE) KOs between the rhizoplane and rhizosphere samples for the two genera were further determined using metatranscriptomic data . In total, 287 and 185 DE KOs were identified for Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia , respectively, including 163 rhizoplane-upregulated and 124 rhizoplane-downregulated KOs for Bradyrhizobium and 89 rhizoplane-upregulated and 96 rhizoplane-downregulated KOs for Burkholderia . The majority of these rhizoplane-upregulated KOs (153 of 163 for Bradyrhizobium and 83 of 89 for Burkholderia ) were not identified when comparing the rhizoplane and rhizosphere samples at the whole community level using metatranscriptomic data. Overrepresentation of multiple KEGG pathways involved in metabolism was observed for the rhizoplane-downregulated KOs for Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia , and consistent enrichment of the categories “energy metabolism” and “carbohydrate metabolism” for both genera was also observed ( p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, two-tail). The Bradyrhizobium rhizoplane-upregulated KOs were enriched in the categories of “transcription” and “metabolism|unclassified,” and the Burkholderia rhizoplane-upregulated KOs were enriched in the categories of “signal transduction” and “cell motility” (Table 1 ). All Burkholderia rhizoplane-upregulated KOs involved in “cell motility” were responsible for flagellar and pilus assembly; the KO representing the flagellar transcriptional activator flhD was found in the “signal transduction” category. Several other efflux system-associated genes, such as mdtA and mdtC , were also present in the Burkholderia “signal transduction” category. The majority of the Bradyrhizobium rhizoplane-upregulated KOs belonging to “metabolism|unclassified” were associated with cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, the gene encoding salicylate hydroxylase which converts salicylic acid, a critical phytohormone for plant systemic acquired resistance, to nonfunctional compound catechol was expressed at a significantly increased level in the rhizoplane compared to the rhizosphere for Bradyrhizobium .

The significant p values were italicized, and the underrepresented items were bolded Effects of inoculated Burkholderia strains on plant fitness Members of Burkholderia have been known to benefit plants. Because Burkholderia are enriched from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane and it is one of the most abundant bacteria associated with citrus roots, we determined the contribution of Burkholderia to the citrus hosts. We isolated multiple Burkholderia strains from the rhizosphere of healthy citrus plants in a relevant study (Riera et al., unpublished data). We selected two representative strains A53 ( Burkholderia metallica ) and A63 ( Burkholderia territori ), which showed the best antagonistic activities against Sinorhizobium meliloti , a relative of the HLB causal agent Las, and several other citrus pathogens, such as Phytophthora spp. and Alternaria alternate (Riera et al., unpublished data), to inoculate citrus plants using the soil drench method. The results demonstrated that the two strains successfully colonized the root surface and maintained significantly higher relative abundance inside the rhizoplane bacterial community than inside the rhizosphere bacterial community (Student’s t test, p < 0.05 for both strains when detected at 5 and 9 dpi) (Additional file 1 : Figure S15), demonstrating that the two strains were more adapted to the rhizoplane niche than that to the rhizosphere. The inoculated strains survived well, even 7 months after inoculation (Figs. 6a, b ). We then conducted a greenhouse study to evaluate the effects of the selected strains on plant fitness. Salicylic acid (SA)-mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) is an important benefit of beneficial bacteria to the plant host [ 70 ]. We determined the expression of three SA-mediated ISR marker genes, SAM, PR1, and PR2, for the inoculated trees. Plants treated with strain A53 exhibited a significant upregulation of PR2 gene at 3 dpi compared to negative control plants. A63 induced expression of the SAM gene at 5 dpi and the PR1 gene at 7 dpi. Similarly, Actigard, an analogue of SA, induced PR1 and SAM gene expression at 5 and 7 dpi (Fig. 6c ). Fig. 6 Survival rates of Burkholderia spp. inoculation and effects on expression of the citrus ISR-associated genes. Colony-forming units were represented in log10 scale for a strain A53 and b strain A63. Colonies were counted in NA plates supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) since both strains are kanamycin-resistant.

Fold change of gene expression is represented at 3, 5, and 7 days post inoculation in root system. Fold change was calculated using ∆∆Ct method. Boxplots represent fold change compared to non-treated plants for three biological replicates. Each biological replicate contains three technical repeats Discussion Our data demonstrated reduced genetic and microbial complexity in the citrus rhizoplane microbiome compared to that in the rhizosphere communities, indicating the filter effect of plant hosts on the closely associated rhizoplane microbiome assembly [ 5 ]. This finding is consistent with previous findings based on annual plants [ 13 , 17 ], indicating that the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment of microbiome occurs in both annual and perennial plants. Our data further suggested that the niche enrichment process is fine-tuned by the plant host for the desired functions, resulting in dramatic structural changes of the microbiome (Fig. 5 ). Bacteria were the most dominant domain and accounted for more than 99% of the citrus root-associated microbiome, whereas minimal Archaea and fungi were found. The taxonomic composition of the citrus root-associated microbiome identified here was very similar with that of wheat and cucumber, where the relative abundance of bacteria is more than 99% [ 15 ]. Proteobacteria , which was dominated by Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia (Fig. 1 ), was enriched on the rhizoplane, and depletion of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria was observed in this process. We demonstrated that the genes involved in utilizing the root-derived carbon source were enriched from the rhizosphere to the rhizoplane, further suggesting the importance of plant cell wall polysaccharide utilization-associated genes for the rhizoplane microbiome. These genes were gradually enriched from the free living bulk soil inoculum, the rhizosphere to the rhizoplane [ 15 ]. However, the genes involved in “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes,” which are critical for autotrophic microorganisms, were depleted in rhizoplane samples, collectively highlighting that the plant-derived carbon sources are an important driving force for citrus rhizoplane microbiome assembly. This finding is consistent with the notion that the microbiome on the rhizoplane enjoys superior access to plant exudates compared to the microbiome in the rhizosphere. Functional features, such as motility, chemotaxis, two-component system and secretion systems, LPS, and type IV pilus synthesis, were rhizoplane-enriched, indicating more active plant-microbe interactions on the rhizoplane than on the rhizosphere. We envision that following chemotaxis sensing, the active motility mediated mainly by flagella and pili allows the microbes to rapidly reach the preferred root surface niches to form biofilms or aggregates with the help of adhesions such as LPS and pili. Interestingly, several secreted effectors were actively expressed in the rhizoplane microbiome that may benefit the microbiome by modulating the plant immune system. Rhizoplane enrichment of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia was observed in this study. Similar enrichment patterns were also observed when analyzing samples collected from 27 important citrus-growing areas worldwide, suggesting the ubiquity and importance of these two genera for the citrus root-associated microbiome (Zhang and Wang, unpublished data). The enrichment of Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia on the rhizoplane indicated their successful strategy for rhizoplane adaption. The metatranscriptomic data demonstrated that the functions involved in metabolic activities were more actively expressed in the rhizosphere than the rhizoplane for both genera, further suggesting that nutrient resources were more easily accessed for the rhizoplane microbiome than the rhizosphere microbiome. In addition to common rhizoplane-enriched genes, multiple Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia specific genes, such as efflux system-associated genes, cell motility-associated genes, and plant defense-resistant-associated genes, were more active on the rhizoplane than the rhizosphere for Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia but were not identified for the remaining microorganisms. The efflux system-associated genes contribute to successful interactions with host plants [ 71 ]. The salicylic acid-degrading enzyme salicylate hydroxylase encoding gene from Bradyrhizobium exhibited significantly increased expression activity on the rhizoplane and might contribute to the colonization of Bradyrhizobium by suppressing the plant defense response [ 72 ]. The relative abundance of the rhizoplane-enriched taxa and functional properties, as well as the expression profiling of the rhizoplane-enriched functional features were significantly reduced by HLB. Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia , the two most dominant rhizoplane-enriched genera, exhibited reduced relative abundance in HLB rhizoplane samples compared to healthy samples. Our previous cultivation-based results demonstrated that the Burkholderia population was significantly increased in the healthy citrus endorhiza microbiome compared to HLB samples, whereas Bradyrhizobium was not observed, mainly because of their slow growth (~2 weeks for colony formation. This is longer than the experiment design, during which colonies were harvested after 3–10 days of incubation) [ 22 ]. These results suggested that the citrus plants prefer Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia and enrich them from the rhizosphere to rhizoplane. The survival rate assay of the two inoculated Burkholderia strains further demonstrated that the Burkholderia strains were more adapted to the rhizoplane niche than the rhizosphere. Root-associated Bradyrhizobium is frequently reported as plant-beneficial bacteria [ 55 , 73 ]; beneficial effects of Burkholderia also are frequently observed [ 22 , 56 , 74 ]. Furthermore, when the citrus were inoculated with Burkholderia strains isolated from the healthy citrus root-associated microbiome, several ISR-associated genes in the citrus trees were induced (Fig. 6 ) that might reduce HLB disease progress. Multiple beneficial bacteria stimulate plant immunity in an SA-dependent ISR manner [ 70 ]. The observed upregulation of ISR-associated genes, especially the upregulation of SAM by Burkholderia sp. inoculation, likely promotes plant health by triggering SA-dependent broad-spectrum systemic resistance to pathogens, which might be an important aspect of plant-beneficial microbe interactions. Other rhizoplane-enriched taxa, such as Variovorax and Bdellovibrio , exhibited decreased relative abundance in the rhizoplane microbiome when trees became infected with Las (Fig. 1 ). Variovorax and Bdellovibrio exhibit plant growth promotion effects [ 57 , 58 ]. Additionally, our results revealed rhizoplane-enriched functional properties, including chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, LPS synthesis and transport, as well as secretion system and related effectors, were depleted by HLB. However, the rhizoplane-depleted functional features, including “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes” and nitrification and denitrification-related genes, exhibited significantly increased relative abundance and expression levels in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome compared to those in the healthy samples (Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 and Additional file 1 : Figures S8–S13). Reduced relative abundance and activity of plant-derived polysaccharide utilization-associated genes together with the increased relative abundance and activity of autotrophic life cycle-adapted carbon fixation, nitrification, and denitrification functional features, support our notion that HLB trees supplied less easy-to-use carbon source, e.g., sucrose for root-associated microbiome use [ 24 ]. These data are consistent with the notion that HLB affects the availability of sucrose to microbes on the rhizoplane because of its effect on phloem transportation of photoassimilates [ 18 ] and root decline [ 20 ]. In particular, HLB affects functional features, such as motility, chemotaxis, two-component system and secretion systems, as well as LPS and type IV pilus synthesis with significantly increased relative abundance and expression levels in the healthy rhizoplane microbiome compared in HLB samples (Fig. 2 ). These findings clearly demonstrated the negative effect on the microbiome at the community level. The negative effects of HLB on the citrus microbiome will ultimately deteriorate the beneficial interactions between the microbiome and the host. Conclusions Overall, we demonstrate that the functional properties involved in host-microbe interactions are critical for the microbiome-inhabiting plant root surfaces and are influenced dramatically by the availability of plant exudates. These rhizoplane-enriched functional properties can subsequently benefit the plant host. HLB not only alters the physiology of the citrus host but also impairs the microbiome-host interaction. Our study provides novel insights for understanding the composition and function of the plant rhizoplane-enriched microbiome and its effect on plant health.
METHODS
. Methods Sample collection Three healthy and three Las-infected 11-year-old “midsweet” sweet orange on Swingle citrumelo rootstock from a grove at Auburndale (28.11 N, 81.79 W), Florida, USA were identified based on visual symptoms and qPCR results [ 24 ] from both leaf and root samples (Additional file 1 : Figure S1). The fine root cores (i.e., roots with approximately 2-cm-thick adjacent soil layers) from four corners of each tree were collected for DNA and RNA extraction. The loosely attached soil on the roots was removed with gentle shaking. The rhizosphere soil was carefully and quickly collected by gently brushing the remaining soil adhering to the roots using brush pencils. The soil collection step was performed on ice. Then, the roots were placed in pre-cooled PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) buffer, and the rhizoplane soil was extracted by ultra-sonication as described by Edwards et al. [ 17 ]. The roots were sonicated twice for 20 s each (time interval 5 s) using a sonication bath (power 130 W, 60 Hz, Fisher Scientific). The roots were discarded, and the rhizoplane soil was collected by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 1 min at 4 °C. Each rhizosphere or rhizoplane soil sample was re-suspended in LifeGuard soil preservation solution (Mobio Laboratories) immediately after processing. The full procedure was performed sample by sample and as quickly as possible (three persons worked together, total processing time was <5 min for each sample). The soil samples from the four corners of each tree were pooled into a single sample. The samples were stored at −20 °C until further processing. Nucleic acid extraction and sequencing DNA and RNA were extracted from 2 g of each soil sample using a RNA PowerSoil total RNA isolation kit and the RNA PowerSoil DNA Elution Accessory Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). In this extraction process, DNA and RNA were extracted from the same sample simultaneously (i.e., DNA and RNA were eluted from the same column with different elution buffer), and thus, the RNA samples reflect the real-time gene expression profiling of the corresponding DNA samples. Large-scale shotgun metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing were performed on the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform by Novogene (Novogene, Beijing, China). Briefly, the DNA samples were randomly sheared using Covaris Ultrasonic Processor into approximately 300 bp fragments, which were then used to construct the sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq® DNA PCR-free sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA). For the RNA samples, the ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero™ rRNA Removal Kit for Bacteria (Illumina, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The remaining transcripts were fragmented and reverse-transcribed. The messenger RNA (mRNA) libraries were prepared using the TrueSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina, USA), and 2 × 125-bp paired-end reads were generated for all samples. Approximately 10 Gb sequencing data for each DNA shotgun sequencing sample and 8 Gb data for each RNA sample were obtained. The DNA and RNA reads were deposited at NCBI under the bioproject accession no. PRJNA324090 and SRA accession no. SRP076109. Bioinformatics analyses The raw reads from metagenome sequencing were filtered, trimmed, and quality-controlled to generate the clean reads, which were further trimmed using Sickle [ 25 ] with the parameters –q 20 and –l 80. On average, 4.85% of the clean reads were discarded from this trimming step. The trimmed reads were aligned to the Swingle citrumelo genome [ 26 ], sweet orange genome [ 27 ], and Citrus clementina genome [ 28 ] using bowtie2 [ 29 ], and the corresponding mapped reads were removed. Only the reads that did not map to any of the three citrus genomes were retained for further analysis. The filtered reads from all 12 samples were pooled and subjected to de novo assembly using megahit v1.03 [ 30 ]. The metagenes were predicted using MetaGeneMark [ 31 ]. The non-redundant gene categories (unigenes) were generated using CD-HIT-est with an identity cutoff of 95% [ 32 ]. To obtain the taxonomic annotation for the unigenes, the protein sequences were aligned against the NCBI microbial NR database using DIAMOND software [ 33 ] with an E value cutoff of 1e-5. Then, the taxonomic annotations were assigned using the MEGAN LCA annotation method [ 34 ]. The functional annotation was assigned to the unigenes by blasting against the KEGG orthology database using DIAMOND software. To generate taxonomic and functional abundance and expression profiling, the short DNA and RNA reads from each sample were aligned to the unigenes using SOAP2 [ 35 ] with default parameters. The generated alignments were parsed, and abundance and expression profiling were obtained (reads count matrixes). Based on the abundance and expression profiles, the features (genera and KOs) with significantly differential abundance or expression activity were determined using DESeq2 with a negative binomial generalized linear model ( p < 0.05) [ 36 ]. For the rhizoplane-enriched feature detection, paired DESeq2 comparison analysis was performed separately for healthy samples and HLB samples to prevent the potential effects of health status on the results, and the identified features were merged. Other comparisons, such as healthy vs. HLB samples for differential rhizoplane taxonomic and functional feature determination, were conducted using DESeq2, where the individual samples from the healthy or HLB trees were treated as biological replicates. The taxonomic and functional dissimilarity analyses among samples were performed using the R package VEGAN [ 37 ] with a Bray-Curtis distance matrix. The variation partitioning analysis (VPA) was performed based on the taxonomic and functional composition matrix calculated on the genus and KEGG orthologue (KO) level of all 12 samples (rhizosphere and rhizoplane, healthy and HLB) using VEGAN. The heatmap and Venn diagram plots were drawn using the gplots and VennDiagram package [ 38 , 39 ], respectively. The average genome size (AGS) for the metagenomic samples was estimated using MicrobeCensus v1.0.7 based on 10 million reads [ 40 ]. The bacterial secretion system-based effector genes were identified by blasting the unigenes against a custom-built type III, IV, and VI effector library (T3SE: http://effectors.bic.nus.edu.sg/T3SEdb/index.php ; T4SE: http://sate.cirad.fr/ ; T6SE: http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/SecReT6/ ) with an amino acid identity cutoff of 45% and a coverage of 80% [ 41 ]. To explore the relative contribution of taxa to the rhizosphere to rhizoplane-enriched KOs, the taxonomic information for each selected gene (at genus and family level) was extracted, and their relationships were calculated using the method described by Ofek-Lalzar et al. [ 15 ]. The metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) extraction was performed using MetaBAT [ 42 ], and the quality of the generated MAGs was checked using CheckM [ 43 ]. The genome similarity between selected MAGs and their related genomes was determined using the GGDC2.1 server [ 44 ]. The MAGs were annotated using the RAST server and blast2GO software [ 45 , 46 ]. The annotated bin.74 and bin.105 were deposited in the RAST server with the job id 311713 and 312590, respectively. Burkholderia sp. isolation and survival assay Bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy citrus plants in a relevant study (Riera et al., Unpublished). Based on the 16S rDNA gene sequencing results using the universal primers 27F and 1492R [ 47 ], the strains were identified. Burkholderia strains were selected for the antagonistic activity test against several known citrus pathogens. Two representative Burkholderia strains, namely, Burkholderia metallica (strain A53) and Burkholderia territori (strain A63), which showed the best antagonistic activities among the tested strains, were selected for further analysis. The two strains were transformed with the pUFR034-gfp plasmid by electroporation. Positive GFP (green fluorescent protein)-labeled strains were verified by fluorescent microscopy and qPCR results. Each transformed Burkholderia strain was applied by soil drench (15 mL of 1 × 10 8 cfu/mL) to five 1-year-old potted “Valencia” sweet orange plants grown in a quarantine greenhouse facility at the Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, in Florida, USA, with controlled temperature (28–35 °C) and a relative humidity of 80%. The rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples were collected as described above (but without the LifeGuard soil preservation solution resuspension step) 1 h after inoculation (0 days post inoculation (dpi)), 2, 5, and 9 dpi. The genomic DNA was extracted using a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). The population dynamics of the inoculated strains inside the rhizosphere and rhizoplane bacterial community (calculated as relative abundance change compared to the 0 dpi data) were calculated [ 48 ], with the total bacteria population serving as the reference. A primer pair targeting the GFP gene (GFPF 5′-TCCATGCCATGTGTAATCCC-3′, GFPR 5′-CCATTACCTGTCCACACAATCT-3′) was used for the detection of the inoculated strains. qPCR assays were conducted on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using a Quantifast® SYBER® Green PCR kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions with the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C and 35 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The primer set Eub338 and Eub518, which targets the conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene, was used for the detection of total bacteria, and qPCR assays were performed as described by Fierer et al. [ 49 ]. Furthermore, the long-term survival rate of the strains was also determined using 2-year-old Duncan grapefruit plants with three plants/replicates grown under the same growth conditions described above. One gram of rhizosphere soil from each tree was collected, and colony-forming units (CFU) were calculated using nutrient agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin (strain native resistance for both strains). The CFU formation was determined at 0, 46, 60, 72, 91, 110, 131, 150, and 224 dpi. Expression of plant defense-related genes in response to beneficial bacteria treatment Fifteen milliliters of 1 × 10 8 cfu/mL of strains A53 and A63 were inoculated onto 1-year-old Valencia plants. Application of 15 mL of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) (active ingredient in Actigard 50WG)  at 0.33 mg/ml was used as a positive control. The active ingredient of Actigard is an analogue of salicylic acid and systemic elicitor of plant defense [ 50 ]. A water only inoculation was used as a negative control. For each treatment, nine seedlings were used, with each seedling as a replicate. To determine whether the treatments induced plant defense, we measured the expression of three defense-related genes: SAM, encoding S -adenosyl- l -methionine-salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase; PR1, encoding pathogenesis-related protein 1; and PR2, encoding pathogenesis-related protein 2 [ 50 ] using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The primer sequences for SAM and PR1 are SAMF 5′-GGACGCATCTTCTTGGGATAA-3′/SAMR 5′-CGTGACAGTTTCCTTGACGA-3′ and PR1F 3′-CAGGGTCTCCAAGCAACTATG-5′/PR1R 5′-CCACCTCGCGTATTTCTCTAA-3′, respectively. The primer sequences for PR2 were described previously [ 50 ]. Gene expression was determined at 0, 3, 5, and 7 dpi. For each time point, three biological repeats were sampled by collecting one leaf from three different plants. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions
