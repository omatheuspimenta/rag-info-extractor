Organism / Species: "midsweet" sweet orange on Swingle citrumelo rootstock.
Genotype / Cultivar / Variety: "midsweet" sweet orange.
Treatment / Experimental Condition: Comparison of healthy vs. Las-infected trees.
Type of Stress / Experimental Factor: Las infection (biotic stress).
Intensity / Level of Treatment: Infection was confirmed by visual symptoms and qPCR results.
Duration / Exposure Time: The trees were 11 years old.
Collection / Cultivation Location: A grove at Auburndale (28.11 N, 81.79 W), Florida, USA.
Soil Type: Not specified, but rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil were the target samples.
Infection Condition: Naturally occurring infection.
Pathogen / Disease: Las (likely Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, causing citrus greening).
Plant Part / Tissue / Organ Sampled: Rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil from fine root cores. The roots themselves were discarded.
Plant Development Stage: Mature trees (11 years old).
Biological Sample Number / Replicate: Three healthy trees and three Las-infected trees. Samples from four corners of each tree were pooled.
Collection Method / RNA / DNA Extraction:
    Collection: Rhizosphere soil was collected by brushing roots. Rhizoplane soil was collected by ultra-sonication of roots in PBS buffer. Samples were preserved in LifeGuard soil preservation solution.
    Extraction Method: Not detailed in this text snippet.
Sequencing Platform / Technology: Not available in the provided text.
Submission Date (SRA / GEO): Not available in the provided text.
Author / Research Group: Not available in the provided text.
Additional Notes / Observations: The study focused on collecting soil samples adhering to the roots, rather than the plant tissue itself.
